  abstract = {We develop theory and numerical algorithms to apply level set methods
	to problems involving the transport and diffusion of material quantities
	in a level set framework. Level set methods are computational techniques
	for tracking moving interfaces; they work by embedding the propagating
	interface as the zero level set of a higher dimensional function,
	and then approximate the solution of the resulting initial value
	partial differential equation using upwind finite difference schemes.
	The traditional level set method works in the trace space of the
	evolving interface, and hence disregards any parameterization in
	the interface description. Consequently, material quantities on the
	interface which themselves are transported under the interface motion
	are not easily handled in this framework. We develop model equations
	and algorithmic techniques to extend the level set method to include
	these problems. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through
	a series of test examples and convergence studies.},

  abstract = {Level set techniques are numerical techniques for tracking the evolution
	of interfaces. They rely on two central embeddings; first, the embedding
	of the interface as the zero level set of a higher dimensional function,
	and second, the embedding (or extension) of the interface's velocity
	to this higher dimensional level set function. This paper applies
	Sethian's Fast Marching Method, which is a very fast technique for
	solving the eikonal and related equations, to the problem of building
	fast and appropriate extension velocities for the neighboring level
	sets. Our choice and construction of extension velocities serves
	several purposes. First, it provides a way of building velocities
	for neighboring level sets in the cases where the velocity is defined
	only on the front itself. Second, it provides a subgrid resolution
	not present in the standard level set approach. Third, it provides
	a way to update an interface according to a given velocity field
	prescribed on the front in such a way that the signed distance function
	is maintained, and the front is never re-initialized; this is valuable
	in many complex simulations. In this paper, we describe the details
	of such implementations, together with speed and convergence tests
	and applications to problems in visibility relevant to semi-conductor
	manufacturing and thin film physics.},

  year = {2010},

  pages = {1909 - 1926},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {In this paper, a Lagrangian particle method is proposed for the simulation
	of multiphase flows with surfactant. The model is based on the multiphase
	smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) framework of Hu and Adams (2006)
	[1]. Surface-active agents (surfactants) are incorporated into our
	method by a scalar quantity describing the local concentration of
	molecules in the bulk phase and on the interface. The surfactant
	dynamics are written in conservative form, thus global mass of surfactant
	is conserved exactly. The transport model of the surfactant accounts
	for advection and diffusion. Within our method, we can simulate insoluble
	surfactant on an arbitrary interface geometry as well as interfacial
	transport such as adsorption or desorption. The flow-field dynamics
	and the surfactant dynamics are coupled through a constitutive equation,
	which relates the local surfactant concentration to the local surface-tension
	coefficient. Hence, the surface-tension model includes capillary
	and Marangoni-forces. The present numerical method is validated by
	comparison with analytic solutions for diffusion and for surfactant
	dynamics. More complex simulations of an oscillating bubble, the
	bubble deformation in a shear flow, and of a Marangoni-force driven
	bubble show the capabilities of our method to simulate interfacial
	flows with surfactants.},

  abstract = {Pressure-driven transport of particles through a symmetric converging-diverging
	microchannel is studied by solving a coupled nonlinear system, which
	is composed of the Navier-Stokes and continuity equations using the
	arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite-element technique. The predicted
	particle translation is in good agreement with existing experimental
	observations. The effects of pressure gradient, particle size, channel
	geometry, and a particle's initial location on the particle transport
	are investigated. The pressure gradient has no effect on the ratio
	of the translational velocity of particles through a converging-diverging
	channel to that in the upstream straight channel. Particles are generally
	accelerated in the converging region and then decelerated in the
	diverging region, with the maximum translational velocity at the
	throat. For particles with diameters close to the width of the channel
	throat, the usual acceleration process is divided into three stages:
	Acceleration, deceleration, and reacceleration instead of a monotonic
	acceleration. Moreover, the maximum translational velocity occurs
	at the end of the first acceleration stage rather than at the throat.
	Along the centerline of the microchannel, particles do not rotate,
	and the closer a particle is located near the channel wall, the higher
	is its rotational velocity. Analysis of the transport of two particles
	demonstrates the feasibility of using a converging-diverging microchannel
	for passive (biological and synthetic) particle separation and ordering.},

  abstract = {Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of a bead-spring polymer
	model has been conducted for polymer melt confined between two solid
	walls. The wall effect was studied by changing the distance between
	the walls and the wall-polymer interaction. It was observed that
	the polymers near the walls are compressed towards the walls: the
	component of the radius of gyration tensor perpendicular to the wall
	surfaces decreases in a layer near the walls. The thickness of this
	surface layer, estimated from the analysis of the static polymer
	structure, is about 1.0-1.5 times the radius of gyration R-g in the
	bulk, and is independent of the distance between the walls and the
	wall-polymer interaction. The relaxation time of the polymers, obtained
	from the autocorrelation of normal modes, increases with increasing
	the strength of the wall-polymer interaction and with decreasing
	the distance between the walls. These wall effects are observed at
	a distance much larger than R-g. This result is in agreement with
	the recent dielectric measurements of cis-polyisoprene confined between
	mica surfaces reported by Cho, Watanabe, and Granick [J. Chem. Phys.
	110, 9688 (1999)]. The thickness of the surface layer was also estimated
	by the position dependence of the static and dynamic properties,

	hypophase. Suspensions of natural surfactant, lipid extract surfactants,
	and artificial surfactants were added to a sodium alginate solution
	and filled into a captive bubble surfactometer (CBS). Surfactant
	film was formed by adsorption to the bubble of the CBS for functional
	tests. There were no discernible differences in adsorption, film
	compressibility or minimal surface tension on quasi-static or dynamic
	compression for films formed in the presence or absence of alginate
	in the subphase of the bubble. The hypophase-film complex was solidified
	by adding calcium ions to the suspension with the alginate. The preparations
	were stained with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate for transmission
	electron microscopy. The most noteworthy findings are: (1) Surfactants
	do adsorb to the surface of the bubble and form osmiophilic lining
	layers. Pure DPPC films could not be visualized. (2) A distinct structure
	of a particular surfactant film depends on the composition and the
	concentration of surfactant in the bulk phase, and on whether or
	not the films are compressed after their formation. The films appear
	heterogeneous, and frequent vesicular and multi-lamellar film segments
	are seen associated with the interfacial films. These features are
	seen already upon film formation by adsorption, but multi-lamellar
	segments are more frequent after film compression. (3) The rate of

  abstract = {The entire alveolar surface is lined by a thin fluid continuum. As
	a consequence, surface forces at the air-liquid interface are operative,
	which in part are transmitted to the delicate lung tissue. Morphologic
	and morphometric analyses of lungs show that the alveolar surface
	forces exert a moulding effect on alveolar tissue elements. In particular,
	in lungs at low degrees of inflation, equivalent to the volume range
	of normal breathing, there is a derecruitment of alveolar surface
	area with increasing surface tensions which reflects equilibrium
	configurations of peripheral air spaces where the sum of tissue energy
	and surface energy is minimum. Thus, changes in surface tension alter
	the recoil pressure of the lung directly and indirectly by deforming
	lung tissue and hence changing tissue tensions. However, the interplay
	between tissue and surface forces is rather complex, and there is
	a marked volume dependence of the shaping influence of surface forces.
	With increasing lung volumes the tissue forces transmitted by the
	fiber scaffold of the lung become the predominant factor of alveolar
	micromechanics: at lung volumes of 80% total lung capacity or more,
	the alveolar surface area-volume relation is largely independent
	of surface tension. Most important, within the range of normal breathing,
	the surface tension, its variations and the associated variations
	in surface area are small. The moulding power of surface forces also
	affects the configuration of capillaries, and hence the microcirculation,
	of free cellular elements such as the alveolar macrophages beneath
	the surface lining layer, and of the surfaces of the peripheral airways.
	Still enigmatic is the coupling mechanism between the fluid continua
	of alveoli and airways which might also be of importance for alveolar
	clearance. As to the surface active lining layer of peripheral air
	spaces, which determines alveolar surface tension, its structure
	and structure-function relationship are still ill-defined owing to
	persisting problems of film preservation and fixation. Electron micrographs
	of alveolar tissue, of lining layers of captive bubbles, and scanning
	force micrographs of surfactant films transferred on mica plates
	reveal a complex structural pattern which precludes so far the formulation
	of an unequivocal hypothesis.},

  abstract = {The most important property of a fluid is its viscosity, it determines
	the flow properties. If one simulates a fluid using a particle model,
	calculating the viscosity accurately is difficult because it is a
	collective property. In this article we describe a new method that
	has a better signal to noise ratio than existing methods. It is based
	on using periodic boundary conditions to simulate counter-flowing
	Poiseuille flows without the use of explicit boundaries. The viscosity
	is then related to the mean flow velocity of the two flows. We apply
	the method to two quite different systems. First, a simple Generic
	fluid model, dissipative particle dynamics, for which accurate values
	of the viscosity are needed to characterize the model fluid. Second;
	the more realistic Lennard-Jones fluid. In both cases the values
	we calculated are consistent with previous work but, for a given
	simulation time, they are more accurate than those obtained with
	other methods. 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

	The diffusivity scales inversely with molecular weight when the channel

	classical molecular dynamics (MD) and computational fluid dynamics

	hybrid code is composed of three regions: a classical MD region,
	a continuum domain where the dynamical equations are solved by standard
	CFD methods, and an overlap domain where transport information from
	the other two domains is exchanged. The exchange of information in
	the overlap region ensures that momentum, energy, and mass are conserved.
	The validity of the hybrid code is demonstrated by studying a single
	polymer tethered to a hard wall immersed in explicit solvent and
	undergoing shear flow. In classical molecular dynamics simulation
	a great deal of computational time is devoted to simulating solvent
	molecules, although the solvent itself is of no direct interest.
	By contrast, the hybrid code simulates the polymer and surrounding
	solvent explicitly, whereas the solvent farther away from the polymer
	is modeled using a continuum description. In the hybrid simulations
	the MD domain is an open system whose number of particles is controlled
	to filter the perturbative density waves produced by the polymer
	motion. We compare conformational properties of the polymer in both
	simulations for various shear rates. In all cases polymer properties
	compare extremely well between the two simulation scenarios, thereby
	demonstrating that this hybrid method is a useful way to model a
	system with polymers and under nonzero flow conditions. There is
	also good agreement between the MD and hybrid schemes and experimental
	data on tethered DNA in flow. The computational cost of the hybrid
	protocol can be reduced to less than 6% of the cost of updating the
	MD forces, confirming the practical value of the method. (C) 2004

	smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is considered. The problem
	arises from insufficient information being available to perform accurate
	interpolation of data at particles located nearer to the boundary
	than the support of the interpolation kernel. The standard method
	for overcoming this problem is based on the introduction of image
	particles to populate the deficient regions and the use of linear
	extrapolation to determine the velocity of these image particles
	from that of fluid particles. A consistent treatment of boundary
	conditions, utilising the momentum equation to obtain approximations
	to the velocity of image particles, is described. The method ensures
	second order approximation of the boundary conditions. It is validated
	for Poiseuille and Couette flow, for which analytical series solutions
	exist and shows second order convergence under certain conditions.

  abstract = {The rheological properties of colloidal suspensions of spheres, rods,
	and disks have been studied using a mesoscopic simulation technique,
	known as dissipative particle dynamics (DPD). In DPD, a suspension
	is modeled as a system of large colloidal particles in a liquid of
	interacting point particles. For the calculation of hydrodynamic
	interactions, this method is computationally more efficient than
	conventional techniques using a continuum model for the solvent.
	Applying a steady-shear rate to the particulate suspensions, we have
	measured the viscosity as a function of shear rate and volume fraction
	of the suspended particles. The viscosity of a 30 vol % suspension
	of spheres displays characteristic shear-thinning behavior as a function
	of increasing shear rate. The values for the high- and low-shear
	viscosity are in good agreement with experimental data. For higher
	particulate densities good results are obtained for the high-shear
	viscosity, although the viscosity at low-shear rates shows a dependence
	on the size of the suspended spheres that we attribute to finite
	size effects. Dilute suspensions of rods and disks show intrinsic
	viscosities which are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.
	For concentrated suspensions of both rods and disks, the viscosity
	increases with the third power of the volume fraction. We find the
	same scaling behavior as predicted by Doi and Edwards [M. Doi and
	S. F. Edwards, The Theory of Polymer Dynamics (Oxford University
	Press, New York, 1986)] for rod suspensions in the semidilute regime.
	The DPD simulation technique emerges asa useful tool for studying

  abstract = {This paper addresses and answers "no" to the question of whether the
	literal molecular-dynamically-derived species velocities prevailing
	at a solid surface bounding a two-component fluid continuum undergoing
	molecular diffusion constitute the appropriate species-velocity boundary
	conditions to be imposed upon the fluid continuum. In a broader context,
	generic boundary condition issues arising from the presence of different
	length scales in continuum-mechanical descriptions of physical phenomena
	are clarified. This is achieved by analyzing a model problem involving
	the steady-state diffusion of a dilute system of Brownian spheres
	(the latter envisioned as tractable models of solute "molecules")
	through a quiescent viscous solvent continuum bounded laterally by
	solid plane walls. Both physicochemical (potential energy) and hydrodynamic
	(steric) wall interaction effects experienced by the Brownian spheres
	are explicitly accounted for in our refined, microscale continuum
	model of the diffusion process. Inclusion of these "solid-wall-fluid"
	(s-f) boundary-generated forces [above and beyond the usual "fluid-fluid''
	(f-f) intermolecular forces implicit in the conventional Fick's law
	macroscale continuum description] serves to simulate the comparable
	s-f molecular boundary forces modeled in molecular dynamics simulations
	of the diffusional process. A singular perturbation framework is
	used to clarify the physical interpretation to be ascribed to "continuum-mechanical
	boundary conditions." In this same spirit we also clearly identify
	the origin of the physical concept of a "surface field" as well as
	of the concomitant surface transport conservation equation fur strongly
	adsorbed species at solid walls. Our analysis of such surface phenomena
	serves to emphasize the fact that these are asymptotic, surface-excess,
	macroscale concepts assigned to a surface, rather than representing
	literal molecular material entities physically confined to the surface.
	Overall, this paper serves to illustrate the manner in which molecular
	simulations need to account for these different length scales and
	corresponding scale-dependent concepts if such analyses are to avoid
	drawing incorrect inferences regarding the molecular origins of continuum-mechanical
	boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of complex fluids often comprises motions of various
	components of the system on a broad range of time and length scales.
	Yet the low frequency linear and stationary non-linear rheology of
	such systems is basically concerned with displacements of centres
	of mass only. It is therefore just natural to try to develop simulation
	models that only keep track of the dynamics of the centres of mass
	of all diffusing constituents. All simulation models developed so
	far, however, have not been very successful mainly because they implicitly
	assume that a huge gap of time scales exists between the eliminated
	and simulated coordinates. In this paper we propose a model, which
	keeps track of slow perturbations of the thermodynamic state of the
	eliminated coordinates induced with every displacement of the simulated
	coordinates. These perturbations give rise to non-equilibrium forces
	in addition to the usual thermodynamic forces deriving from the potential
	of mean force. Because these forces slowly fade away when the perturbations
	of the eliminated coordinates relax towards equilibrium, they are
	called transient forces. In the first part of the paper the model
	is presented in a most general way in order to provide a framework
	that can be applied to a broad range of soft matter systems. In the
	second part the general framework is further detailed in several
	applications to derive special models that have been applied with
	great success in recent years. One example is given of the elimination
	of external coordinates.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study continuum models for surface diffusion
	taking into account free adatoms on the surface, which is of particular
	importance in the (self-assembled) growth of nanostructures. The
	extended model yields a coupled system of parabolic differential
	equations for the surface morphology and the adatom density, involving
	a cross-diffusion structure. We investigate two different situations,
	namely the growth of a film on a substrate and the growth of a crystal-like
	structure (a closed curve or surface). An investigation of the equilibrium
	situation, which can be phrased as an energy minimization problem
	subject to a mass constraint, shows a different behaviour in both
	situations: for the film the equilibrium is attained when all atoms
	are attached to the surface, while for a crystal the adatom density
	does not vanish on the surface. The latter is also a deviation from
	the usual equilibrium theory, since the equilibrium shape will be
	strictly included in the Wulff shape. Moreover, it turns out that
	the total energy is not lower semicontinuous and non-convex for large
	adatom densities and rough surfaces. The dynamics of the adatom surface
	diffusion model is investigated in detail for situations close to
	a flat surface in the film case and the situation close to a radially
	symmetric curve, both with an almost spatially homogeneous adatom
	density, where the cross-diffusion structure of the model and the
	decay to equilibrium can be studied in detail. Finally, we discuss
	the numerical solution of the adatom surface diffusion model in the
	film case and provide various simulation results.},

  abstract = {The velocity and stress autocorrelation decay in a dissipative particle
	dynamics ideal fluid model is analyzed in this paper. The autocorrelation
	functions are calculated at three different friction parameters and
	three different time steps using the well-known Groot/Warren algorithm
	and newer algorithms including self-consistent leap-frog, self-consistent
	velocity Verlet and Shardlow first and second order integrators.
	At low friction values, the velocity autocorrelation function decays
	exponentially at short times, shows slower-than exponential decay
	at intermediate times, and approaches zero at long times for all
	five integrators. As friction value increases, the deviation from
	exponential behavior occurs earlier and is more pronounced. At small
	time steps, all the integrators give identical decay profiles. As
	time step increases, there are qualitative and quantitative differences
	between the integrators. The stress correlation behavior is markedly
	different for the algorithms. The self-consistent velocity Verlet
	and the Shardlow algorithms show very similar stress autocorrelation
	decay with change in friction parameter, whereas the Groot/Warren
	and leap-frog schemes show variations at higher friction factors.
	Diffusion coefficients and shear viscosities are calculated using
	Green-Kubo integration of the velocity and stress autocorrelation
	functions. The diffusion coefficients match well-known theoretical
	results at low friction limits. Although the stress autocorrelation
	function is different for each integrator, fluctuates rapidly, and
	gives poor statistics for most of the cases, the calculated shear
	viscosities still fall within range of theoretical predictions and

	(similar to 10(3) g) on individual flexible polymers. We were able
	to employ this microfluidic-based approach to adjust and control
	flow velocity and acceleration to observe real-time dynamics of fluorescently
	labeled lambda-phage DNA molecules in our device. This allowed us
	to impose mechanical stimulation including stretching and bending
	on single molecules in localized regimes through a simple and straightforward
	technology-based method. We found that the flexible DNA molecules
	exhibited multimodal responses including distinct conformations and
	controllable curvatures; these characteristics were directly related
	to both the elongation and bending dynamics dictated by their locations
	within the curvilinear flow. We analyzed the dynamics of these individual
	molecules to determine their elongation strain rates and curvatures
	(similar to 0.09 mu m(-1)) at different locations in this system
	to probe the individual polymer structural response. These results
	demonstrate our ability to create high radial acceleration flow and
	observe realtime dynamic responses applied directly to individual
	DNA molecules. This approach may also be useful for studying other
	biologically based polymers including additional nucleic acids, actin
	filaments, and microtubules and provide a platform to understand
	the material properties of flexible polymers at a small scale.},

	It was suggested that discrepancies found between the simulations

	problems. Because these problems often have complicated fluid dynamics,
	there are advantages in solving them using Lagrangian methods like
	smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Since SPH particles become
	disordered, the second derivative terms may be estimated poorly,
	especially when materials with different properties are adjacent.
	In this paper we show how a simple alteration to the standard SPH
	formulation ensures continuity of heat flux across discontinuities
	in material properties. A set of rules is formulated for the construction
	of isothermal boundaries leading to accurate conduction solutions.
	A method for accurate prediction of heat fluxes through isothermal
	boundaries is also given. The accuracy of the SPH conduction solutions
	is demonstrated through a sequence of test problems of increasing

	like chains, including real space chain coupling, in shearing flows,
	Extending existing simulation techniques, we examine the microstructure
	of such concentrated polymer systems at both equilibrium and in "Fast"
	shear flows and compare our simulation results with experimental
	single molecule data for DNA and with bulk rheological measurements.
	At equilibrium we verify that our Simulation technique predicts that
	the longest relaxation time of the system scales as the number of
	entanglements to the 3.4 power. Time traces of polymer conformation
	near equilibrium show fluctuations not only in the flow and gradient
	directions but also in the vorticity direction as well. At stronger
	flow rates, we demonstrate the existence of large stretching in the
	flow-gradient plane coupled to rotational fluctuations which result
	in polymer tumbling. Under such nonequilibrium flows, we find excellent
	agreement with single molecule data with regard to the configurational
	variability of individual molecules for (gamma) over dot tau(R) <=
	5. Both experiments and our simulation data show that chain extension
	exhibits a wide range of values with maximum extension exceeding
	40%. Furthermore, histograms of chain orientation, measured via simulations,
	are symmetric around 45 degrees and then become skewed toward 0 degrees
	as the flow strength is increased. However, even under relatively
	fast flows, the average angle decreases only modestly, and thus strong
	alignment is never observed. Also in agreement with single molecule
	data is Our simulated variation of the power spectral density of
	chain size projected in the flow direction, which decays as omega(m)
	where m similar to -15 and m = -2 for slow and fast flows, respectively.
	Finally, Our simulations are able to predict the onset of a plateau
	in shear stress for tau(-1)(D) < (gamma) over dot < tau(-1)(R) and
	also a dip in the linear viscoelastic loss modulus at intermediate
	frequencies, both classic signatures of entanglement. Our shear stress
	results are in quantitative agreement with experimental rheological
	data for T4-DNA. We find that the size of the polymer in the flow
	and the gradient directions are relatively constant in the range
	of now rates corresponding to the shear stress plateau. Only upon
	the imposition of higher shear rates, when the shear stresses exhibit
	an upturn after the plateau, do the two size measures display significant
	variations. These "frozen" changes in the size and orientation of
	the chains are the microscale cause of the shear stress plateau in
	our Simulations,},

  abstract = {In this work, we examine the conformational dynamics of long polymer
	molecules under confinement, as in the recently developed anti-Brownian
	electrokinetic (ABEL) trap [A. Cohen and W. Moerner, Proc. Natl.
	Acad. Sci. USA. 103, 4362 (2006)]. We analyze polymer motion using
	Brownian dynamics simulations (bead-spring and bead-rod models) and
	via Monte Carlo methods. We first verify Cohen and Moerner's (2007)
	single molecule observations regarding the existence of short time
	correlations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 116001 (2007)] in the motion of
	a polymer's center of mass, which arise due to fluctuating hydrodynamic
	interactions. Thereafter, following Cohen and Moerner, we use principal
	component analysis to extract the principal modes governing polymer
	conformation and find that confinement and backbone bending only
	affect small polymers and should not play a significant role in the
	dynamics of long polymers such as lambda-DNA. We find excellent agreement
	between our principal component analysis modes and those measured
	by Cohen and Moerner [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 12622 (2007)].
	Finally, to explore the effect of excluded volume, in particular,
	the effect of the excluded volume parameter (z), we use image-image
	correlations to examine its relation to polymer dynamics. Image-image
	correlation measurements performed on lambda-DNA in the ABEL trap
	did not display a simple exponential-type behavior and motivated
	the use of stretched exponential functions to determine the characteristic
	timescale (tau) governing conformational dynamics. We show that tau
	scales with polymer length as N-2 and decreases with increasing z.
	Furthermore, we can collapse a variety of data when tau N-2 is plotted
	with respect to N/z(m) (m=0.14 for freespace and 0.366 for walls).},

  abstract = {The pressure-driven transport of DNA was studied in slit-like nanochannels
	with an embedded nanotopography consisting of linear arrays of nanopits.
	We imaged individual DNA molecules moving single-file down the nanopit
	array, undergoing sequential pit-to-pit hops using fluorescence video
	microscopy. Distinct transport dynamics were observed depending on
	whether a molecule could occupy a single pit, or was forced to subtend
	multiple pits. We interpret these results in terms of a scaling theory
	of the free energy of polymer chains in a linear array of pits. Molecules
	contained within a single pit are predicted to face an entropic free
	energy barrier, and to hop between pits by thermally activated transport.
	Molecules that subtend multiple pits, on the other hand, can transfer
	DNA contour from upstream to downstream pits in response to an applied
	fluid flow, which lowers the energy barrier. When the trailing pit
	completely empties, or when the leading pit reaches its capacity,
	the energy barrier is predicted to vanish, and the low-pressure,
	thermally activated transport regime gives way to a high-pressure,
	dissipative transport regime. These results contribute to our understanding
	of polymers in nanoconfined environments, and may guide the development

	for a semiflexible chain. Comparison with previous Brownian dynamics
	Simulations (which exclude both solvent and wall potential) indicates

  abstract = {Results of a molecular dynamics simulation of a single polymer chain
	in a good solvent are presented. The latter is modeled explicitly
	as a bath of particles. This system provides a first-principles microscopic
	test of the hydrodynamic Kirkwood-Zimm theory of the chain's Brownian
	motion. A 30 monomer chain is studied in 4066 sol vent particles
	as well as 40/4056 and 60/7940 systems. The density was chosen rather
	high, in order to come close to the ideal situation of incompressible
	flow, and to ensure that diffusive momentum transport is much faster
	than particle motions. In order to cope with the numerical instability
	of microcanonical algorithms, we generate starting states by a Langevin
	simulation that includes a coupling to a heat bath, which is switched
	off for the analysis of the dynamics. The long range of the hydrodynamic
	interaction induces a large effect of finite box size on the diffusive
	properties, which is observable for the diffusion constants of both
	the chain and the solvent particles. The Kirkwood theory of the diffusion
	constant, as well as the Akcasu et al. theory of the initial decay
	rate in dynamic light scattering are generalized for the finite box
	case, replacing the Oseen tensor by the corresponding Ewald sum.
	In leading order, the finite-size corrections are inversely proportional
	to the linear box dimensions. With this modification of the theory
	taken into account, the Kirkwood formula for the diffusion constant
	is verified. Moreover, the monomer motions exhibit a scaling that
	is much closer to Zimm than to Rouse exponents (t2/3 law in the mean
	square displacement; decay rate of the dynamic structure factor is-proportional-to
	k3). However, the prefactors are not consistent with the theory,
	indicating that (on the involved short length scales) the dynamics
	is more complex than the simple hydrodynamic description suggests.},

	fluids. As opposed to solving a pressure Poisson equation in order
	to get a divergence-free velocity field, here incompressibility is
	achieved by requiring as a kinematic constraint that the volume of
	the fluid particles is constant. We use Lagrangian multipliers to
	enforce this restriction. These Lagrange multipliers play the role
	of non-thermodynamic pressures whose actual values are fixed through
	the kinematic restriction. We use the SHAKE methodology familiar
	in constrained molecular dynamics as an efficient method for finding
	the non-thermodynamic pressure satisfying the constraints. The model
	is tested for several flow configurations.},

  abstract = {Two instruments, the pulsating bubble surfactometer (PBS) and the
	capillary surfactometer (CS), were constructed for a study of pulmonary
	surfactant's physical properties. The instruments study spherical
	surfaces as in alveoli (PBS) and cylindrical surfaces as in terminal
	conducting airways (CS). Phospholipids, pulmonary surfactant's main
	components, are amphiphilic and, therefore, spontaneously form a
	film at air-liquid interfaces. When the film in the PBS is compressed
	to a reduced area during `expiration', the molecules come closer
	together. Thereby, a high surface pressure develops, causing surface
	tension to be reduced more than bubble radius. If these conditions,
	observed with the PBS are analogous in lungs, alveolar stability
	would be promoted. The CS was developed for a study of how surfactant
	has ability to maintain patency of narrow conducting airways. Provided
	adsorption is extremely fast, a surfactant film will line the terminal
	conducting airway as soon as liquid blocking the airway has been
	extruded. During expiration that film will develop high surface pressure
	(=low surface tension). This will counteract the tendency for liquid
	to accumulate in the airway's most narrow section. If surfactant
	is dysfunctioning, liquid is likely to accumulate and block terminal
	airways. Airway resistance would then increase, causing FEV1 to be
	reduced.},

	quartz crystal microbalance or QCM changed its response to sucrose
	solutions according to its angle of immersion. The effect was tentatively
	attributed to gravity-caused stress on the viscous interface between
	the oscillator and the bulk solution. The present work reports results
	from QCM experiments carried out so that any effect of gravity on
	the interfacial region would be magnified. This permitted use of
	a lower-frequency, less-sensitive QCM. Molecules of DNA were tethered
	to a functionalized QCM surface and then extended in steps, via sandwich
	hybridization, to produce DNA of uniform and known length. This feature
	allowed both the effect of QCM immersion angle and the relationship
	between frequency and molecular length to be investigated simultaneously.
	Comparison of acoustic wave damping at 0degrees and 180degrees immersion
	angles offers compelling evidence that the interfacial region expands
	when the active face of the QCM is down and contracts when it is
	up. This is apparently a consequence of the interfacial region being
	more dense than the bulk solution. The results are consistent with
	(a) slow gravity-driven movement of molecules away from a down-facing
	QCM, (b) rapid hybridization-driven movement away from an up-facing
	QCM, and (c) a QCM frequency response that decreases according to
	a simple exponential function of the tethered molecules' radius of

	shear-rate regimes the RPF properties are confirmed to be in good
	agreement with those calculated from plane Couette flow with Lees-Edwards
	periodic boundary conditions (LECs), the standard virtual rheometer
	for steady shear-rate properties. The concentration and the temperature
	dependence of the properties of the model fluids are shown to satisfy
	the principles of concentration and temperature superposition commonly
	employed in the empirical correlation of real polymer-fluid properties.
	The thermodynamic validity of the equation of state is found to be
	a crucial factor for the achievement of time-temperature superposition.
	With these models, RPF is demonstrated to be an accurate and convenient
	virtual rheometer for the acquisition of steady shear-rate rheological
	properties. It complements, confirms, and extends the results obtained
	with the standard LEC configuration, and it can be used with the
	output from other particle-based methods, including molecular dynamics,
	Brownian dynamics, smooth particle hydrodynamics, and the lattice

	in which the channel gap is of the same order as the size of the
	suspended particles or macromolecules. In such systems depletion
	layers are observed near solid-fluid interfaces, even in equilibrium,
	and the imposition of flow results in further cross-stream migration
	of the particles. In this work we employ dissipative particle dynamics
	to study depletion and migration in dilute polymer solutions in channels
	several times larger than the radius of gyration (R-g) of bead-spring
	chains. We compare depletion layers for different chain models and
	levels of chain representation, solvent quality, and relative wall-solvent-polymer
	interactions. By suitable scaling the simulated depletion layers
	compare well with the asymptotic lattice theory solution of depletion
	near a repulsive wall. In Poiseuille flow, polymer migration across
	the streamlines increases with the Peclet and the Reynolds number
	until the center-of-mass distribution develops two symmetric off-center
	peaks which identify the preferred chain positions across the channel.

	simulation approach, which has been successfully applied in modeling
	complex fluids in periodic domains. A recent modification [X.J. Fan,

	suspension using dissipative particle dynamics, Physics of Fluids
	18 (6) (2006) 063102] has allowed DPD simulations of polymers for
	realistic values of the Schmidt number. However, DPD and its extensions
	encounter difficulties in simulating even simple fluids in wall-bounded
	domains. The two main problems are wall boundary conditions and compressibility
	effects - the topic of the present work - which limit the application
	of DPD to low Reynolds number (Re) flows (e.g., Re < 100). Here,
	we establish an empirical criterion that provides an upper limit
	in velocity and correspondingly in Re for a fixed computational domain,
	assuming a deviation from Navier-Stokes solutions of at most 5%.
	This limit could be increased by increasing the size of the computational
	domain at approximately linear computational cost. Results are presented
	for the lid-driven cavity flow reaching, for first time, Re = 1000,
	and similar extensions can be established for other complex-geometry
	flows. A systematic investigation is presented with respect to both
	different types of boundary conditions and compressibility effects

  abstract = {In many experiments, the aim is to deduce an underlying multisubstate
	on-off kinetic scheme (KS) from the statistical properties of a two-state
	trajectory. However, a two-state trajectory that is generated from
	an on-off KS contains only partial information about the KS, and
	so, in many cases, more than one KS can be associated with the data.
	We recently showed that the optimal way to solve this problem is
	to use canonical forms of reduced dimensions (RDs). RD forms are
	on-off networks with connections only between substates of different
	states, where the connections can have nonexponential waiting time
	probability density functions (WT-PDFs). In theory, only a single
	RD form can be associated with the data. To utilize RD forms in the
	analysis of the data, a RD form should be associated with the data.
	Here, we give a toolbox for building a RD form from a finite time,
	noiseless, two-state trajectory. The methods in the toolbox are based
	on known statistical methods in data analysis, combined with statistical
	methods and numerical algorithms designed specifically for the current
	problem. Our toolbox is self-contained-it builds a mechanism based
	only on the information it extracts from the data, and its implementation
	is fast (analyzing a 10(6) cycle trajectory from a 30-parameter mechanism
	takes a couple of hours on a PC with a 2.66 GHz processor). The toolbox
	is automated and is freely available for academic research upon electronic

  abstract = {A new balanced-force algorithm is presented for modeling interfacial
	flow with surface tension. The algorithm is characterized by a pressure-correction
	method with the interfaces represented by volume fractions. Within
	this flow algorithm, we devise a continuous (e.g., continuum surface
	tension model) and a sharp (e.g., a ghost fluid method) interface
	representation of the surface-tension-induced interfacial pressure
	jump condition. The sharp interface representation is achieved by
	temporarily reconstructing distance functions from volume fractions.
	We demonstrate that a flow algorithm designed to legislate force
	balance retains an exact balance between surface tension forces and
	the resulting pressure gradients. This balance holds for both continuous
	and sharp representations of interfacial surface tension. The algorithm
	design eliminates one of the elusive impediments to more accurate
	models of surface tension-driven flow, the remaining of which is
	accurate curvature estimation. To validate our formulation, we present
	results for an equilibrium (static) drop in two and three dimensions
	having an arbitrary density jump across the interface. We find that
	the sharp surface tension method yields an abrupt pressure jump across
	the interface, whereas the continuous surface tension method results
	in a smoother transition. Both methods, however, yield spurious velocities
	of the same order, the origin of which is due solely to errors in
	curvature. Dynamic results are also presented to illustrate the versatility
	of the method.},

	for fluid flow, which was introduced by Malevanets and Kapral in
	1999, and is now called multi-particle collision dynamics (MPC) or
	stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD). The method consists of alternating
	streaming and collision steps in an ensemble of point particles.
	The multi-particle collisions are performed by grouping particles
	in collision cells, and mass, momentum, and energy are locally conserved.
	This simulation technique captures both full hydrodynamic interactions
	and thermal fluctuations. The first part of the review begins with
	a description of several widely used MPC algorithms and then discusses
	important features of the original SRD algorithm and frequently used
	variations. Two complementary approaches for deriving the hydrodynamic
	equations and evaluating the transport coefficients are reviewed.
	It is then shown how MPC algorithms can be generalized to model non-ideal
	fluids, and binary mixtures with a consolute point. The importance
	of angular-momentum conservation for systems like phase-separated
	liquids with different viscosities is discussed. The second part
	of the review describes a number of recent applications of MPC algorithms
	to study colloid and polymer dynamics, the behavior of vesicles and

	using techniques such as optical tweezers and videomicroscopy. An
	interesting and important single-molecule problem is that of the
	dynamics of a polymer chain tethered to a solid surface and subjected
	to a shear flow. An experimental study of such a system was reported
	by Doyle et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 4769 (2000)), and their results
	showed a surprising recirculating motion of the DNA chain. We explore
	this problem using molecular dynamics computer simulations with explicit
	hydrodynamic interactions. The dynamical properties of a Freely Jointed
	Chain (FJC) with Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic (FENE) links
	are examined in similar conditions (i.e., confined between two surfaces
	and in the presence of a Poiseuille flow). We see the remarkable
	cyclic polymer motion observed experimentally, and we show that a
	simple cross-correlation function can be used to measure the corresponding
	period of motion. We also propose a new empirical equation relating
	the magnitude of the shear flow to the amount of chain deformation,
	an equation that appears to apply for both weak and strong flows.
	Finally, we report on packing effects near the molecularly flat wall,
	an associated chain-sticking phenomenon, and the impact of the chain
	hydrodynamic drag on the local fluid flow.},

  abstract = {A melt of linear diblock copolymers (A(n)B(m)) can form a diverse
	range of microphase separated structures. The detailed morphology
	of the microstructure depends on the length of the polymer blocks
	A(n) and B-m and their mutual solubility. In this paper, the role
	of hydrodynamic forces in microphase formation is studied. The microphase
	separation of block copolymer melts is simulated using two continuum
	methods: dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and Brownian dynamics
	(BD). Although both methods produce the correct equilibrium distribution
	of polymer chains, the BD simulation does not include hydrodynamic
	interactions, whereas the DPD method correctly simulates the (compressible)
	Navier Stokes behavior of the melt. To quantify the mesophase structure,
	we introduce a new order parameter that goes beyond the usual local
	segregation parameter and is sensitive to the morphology of the system.
	In the DPD simulation, a melt of asymmetric block copolymers rapidly
	evolves towards the hexagonal structure that is predicted by mean-field
	theory, and that is observed in experiments. In contrast, the BD
	simulation remains in a metastable state consisting of interconnected
	tubes, and fails to reach equilibrium on a reasonable time scale.
	This demonstrates that the hydrodynamic forces play a critical part
	in the kinetics of microphase separation into the hexagonal phase.
	For symmetric block copolymers, hydrodynamics appears not to be crucial
	for the evolution. Consequently, the lamellar phase forms an order
	of magnitude faster than the hexagonal phase does, and thus it would
	be reasonable to infer a higher viscosity for the hexagonal phase
	than for the lamellar phase. The simulations suggest that the underlying
	cause of this difference is that the hexagonal phase forms via a
	metastable gyroid-like structure, and therefore forms via a nucleation-and-growth
	mechanism, whereas the lamellar phase is formed via spinodal decomposition.

  abstract = {Direct measurement techniques are employed to quantify the kinematics
	of DNA flows in a 2:1 planar abrupt micro-contraction. Flow through
	micro-contractions subjects the fluid to large spatial gradients
	in velocity, leading to viscoelastic effects. This study investigates
	the flow of semi-dilute X-DNA solutions in a 2:1 micro-contraction
	for low Reynolds numbers (6.0 x 10(-7) < Re < 9.8 x 10(-2)) and high
	Weissenberg numbers (0.8 < Wi < 629). We thus access high elasticity
	number flows (6.4 x 10(3) < El = Wi/Re < 1.4 x 10(6)): flows with
	El > 10(5) have been previously unexplored in experiments. Video
	microscopy and streak images reveal highly elastic behavior evidenced
	by the presence of large, stable vortices symmetric about the centerline
	in the corners of the contraction. Digital particle image velocimetry
	(DPIV) is used to obtain high resolution, quantitative measurements
	of the velocity fields and in particular the vortex growth in this
	micro-contraction flow. We believe these are among the first measurements
	of this type in a viscoelastic microflow and the first involving
	DNA solutions. Knowledge of the fundamental physics that governs
	viscoelastic microflows will have a profound impact on optimization
	of lab-on-a-chip systems incorporating macromolecular flows. (C)

  abstract = {The behavior of a single polyethylene chain grafted to an impenetrable
	surface, under shear flow, is investigated using Brownian dynamics
	simulations. Both short-range conformational energies and excluded
	volume effects are included in the model. Simulations are performed
	in good and poor solvent conditions in order to explore the effect
	of solvent quality. The shear flow is represented by the superposition
	of a force profile increasing linearly with the distance from the
	surface. Distribution of relational angles, chain dimensions, components
	of the radius of gyration, segment density distribution, average
	layer thickness, and average orientation of bond vectors with respect
	to flow direction are determined and compared with other studies.
	Above a certain value of the shear rate, a significant increase in
	chain dimensions is observed for both good and poor solvents, the
	transition from coiled to stretched state being sharper in poor solvent.
	In good solvent, chain dimensions along the two perpendicular directions
	to the flow direction diminish with increasing shear rate. On the
	other hand, in poor solvent, there is an overall expansion in chain
	dimensions in all directions at low shear rates, which is subsequently
	followed by the orientation and alignment of the chain along the
	direction of flow. The experimentally observed increase in chain
	dimensions normal to the flow field at low shear rates is evidenced
	for the first time by simulations. (C) 1996 American Institute of

	the end-monomer dynamics of semiflexible polymers through Brownian
	hydrodynamic simulations and dynamic mean-field theory. Precise experimental
	observations over the past few years of end-monomer dynamics in the
	diffusion of double-stranded DNA have given conflicting results:
	one study indicated an unexpected Rouse-like scaling of the mean-squared
	displacement (MSD) < r(2)(t)> similar to t(1/2) at intermediate times,
	corresponding to fluctuations at length scales larger than the persistence
	length but smaller than the coil size; another study claimed the
	more conventional Zimm scaling < r(2)(t)> similar to t(2/3) in the
	same time range. Using hydrodynamic simulations as well as analytical
	and scaling theories, we find a novel intermediate dynamical regime
	where the effective local exponent of the end-monomer MSD, alpha(t)
	= d(log < r(2)(t)>)/d(log t) drops below the Zimm value of 2/3 for
	sufficiently long chains. The deviation from the Zimm prediction
	increases with chain length, though it does not reach the Rouse limit
	of 1/2. The qualitative features of this intermediate regime, found
	in simulations and in an improved mean-field theory for semiflexible
	polymers, in particular the variation of alpha(t) with chain and
	persistence lengths, can be reproduced through a heuristic scaling
	argument. Anomalously low values of the effective exponent a are
	explained by hydrodynamic effects related to the slow crossover from
	dynamics on length scales smaller than the persistence length to
	dynamics on larger length scales.},

	adsorption in shear flow using Brownian dynamics simulations with
	hydrodynamic interaction (HI). The polyelectrolyte is modeled as
	a freely jointed bead-rod chain, and electrostatic and non-electrostatic
	interactions are accounted for by using screened Coulombic and Lennard-Jones
	potentials, respectively. In the absence of flow, the conformation
	of a polyelectrolyte molecule adsorbed onto a uniformly charged surface
	changes from flat to globular with an increase in bead-bead attraction
	(hydrophobicity), consistent with prior experimental observations.
	In the presence of flow, migration due to bead-wall HI and, as a
	consequence, desorption decrease with an increase in bead-bead attraction,
	implying that flow-induced desorption is more difficult under poor-solvent
	conditions. When bead-bead non-electrostatic attraction is strong,
	desorption can be enhanced by increasing bead-bead electrostatic
	repulsion. Analogous to the effect of bead-surface electrostatic
	attraction, an increase in the strength of bead-surface non-electrostatic
	attraction reduces desorption. We also study the effect of shear
	flow on the adsorption of a polyelectrolyte molecule onto surfaces
	decorated with periodic arrays of charged patches. An increase in
	patch periodicity increases desorption even when the effective surface
	charge density is kept the same. The results of this work suggest
	mechanisms for controlling the desorption of polyelectrolyte molecules

  abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) particle approximation equations
	for functions and their derivatives are analyzed in stable field.
	Three criterions for determining suitable kernels are proposed to
	evaluate the accuracy of computation. The first criterion is used
	to evaluate the estimation errors of the functions. The second and
	third criterions are for the first derivatives of the functions.
	The second criterion requires that the first derivative of a kernel
	should be zero when the position of the neighbor particle is approaching
	the estimated one. The third criterion is so defined that the particle
	estimation of the first derivatives in stable field should be zero.
	Ten SPH kernels with different orders of function are selected to
	demonstrate the application of the criterions. The effects of the
	position of the estimated particles and the smoothing length on behaviors
	of the kernels are analyzed. To verify the feasibility of the three
	criterions in dynamic field, one dimensional shock tube problem is
	simulated with four deliberately chosen kernels. The simulation results,
	including profiles of density, pressure, velocity and energy, are
	compared with the exact solutions. Through analyses, it is found
	that the three criterions proposed in this study are feasible to
	evaluate the properties of kernels. Of the three criterions, the
	first one is more critical than the other two. In terms of computational
	accuracy, Gaussian and Q-spline kernels can be regarded as the best
	kernels of the ten proposed kernels in this study.},

	We find that tau(1) similar to M(2.45)h(-0.92) , in partial agreement

	The experimental results suggest that the assumptions of both a 2-dimensional

	of different polymer models which have been used to examine the recent
	experimental findings of Smith et ad. (1999) who studied the dynamics
	of a single DNA molecule in steady shear flow. The steady average
	extension at various Weissenberg numbers (Wi) is shown to be well
	predicted by multimode nonlinear models. Quite surprisingly, the
	normalized average extension x/L asymptotes to less than 1/2 even
	for extremely large Wi and we discuss this result on a physical basis.
	The probability density function of molecular extension at various

	nonlinear elastic dumbbell suggests that the number of internal modes

	DNA molecule. Three different frequency regimes in the power spectral
	density observed at finite Wi in the experiments are shown to arise
	from the coupling of the Brownian fluctuations in the gradient direction

  abstract = {The relaxation behaviour of an initially-stretched, tethered flexible
	polymer chain is studied using the bead-spring model and the Brownian
	dynamics simulation method. Simulations are performed with and without
	the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions. Relaxation is studied
	in the presence of a shear flow field, characterised by Weissenberg
	numbers in the range 0 <= Wi <= 55. The presence of a substrate is
	observed to slow the relaxation of the polymer chain markedly. When
	shear flow is applied two types of relaxation behaviour are observed,
	for timescales which are short compared with the longest relaxation
	time of the chain. For Wi smaller than a critical value, the behaviour
	is dominated by the entropic collapse of the chain, accompanied by
	a degree of rotation in the flow. However, above the critical value
	of Wi, the polymer chain behaves as an almost rigid rod, initially
	relaxing slightly, and then stretching as it rotates in the flow.
	The chain attains a maximum value of extension after which an approximately
	linear relaxation is observed. At long timescales a steady-state
	extension is reached which varies with the value of Wi. The inclusion
	of hydrodynamic interactions does not qualitatively affect the observed
	behaviour. However, it is found that hydrodynamic interactions accelerate
	the chain relaxation in the absence of flow, while leading to a marked
	slowing of chain relaxation when shear flows are applied.},

	Surface tension was measured over a range of oscillation frequencies
	(1-100 cycles/min) and bulk phase concentrations (0.01-1 mg/ml) by
	using a pulsating bubble surfactometer. Distinct differences in behavior
	were seen between samples. These differences were interpreted by
	using a previously validated model of surfactant adsorption kinetics
	that describes function in terms of 1) adsorption rate coefficient
	(k1), 2) desorption rate coefficient (k2), 3) minimum equilibrium
	surface tension ([gamma]*), 4) minimum surface tension at film collapse
	([gamma]min), and 5) change in surface tension with interfacial area
	for [gamma] < [gamma]* (m2). Results show that DPPC and PL have k1
	and k2 values several orders of magnitude lower than CLS. PL had
	a [gamma]min of 19-20 dyn/cm, significantly greater than CLS (nearly
	zero). Addition of the HA to PL restored dynamic interfacial behavior
	to nearly that of CLS. However, m2 remained at a reduced level. Addition
	of the SP-A to PL + HA restored m2 to a level similar to that of
	CLS. No further improvement in function occurred with the addition
	of the neutral lipid. These results support prior studies that show
	addition of HA to the PL markedly increases adsorption and film stability.
	However, SP-A is required to completely normalize dynamic behavior.},

	for a model of DNA molecules of similar to10-100 mum contour length

	The mechanisms for migration are illustrated using a simple kinetic

  abstract = {The dominating functional property of pulmonary surfactant is to reduce
	the surface tension at the alveolar air/liquid interface, and thereby
	prevent the lungs from collapsing at the end of expiration. In addition,
	the system exhibits host-defense properties. Insufficient amounts
	of pulmonary surfactant in premature infants causes respiratory distress
	syndrome, a serious threat which nowadays can be effectively treated
	by airway instillation of surfactant preparations. Surfactant is
	a mixture of many molecular species, mainly phospholipids and specific
	proteins, surfactant protein A (SP-A), SP-B, SP-C and SP-D. SP-A
	and SP-D are water-soluble and belong to the collectins, a family
	of large multimeric proteins which structurally exhibit collagenous/lectin
	hybrid properties and functionally are Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate
	binding proteins involved in innate host-defence functions. SP-A
	and SP-D also bind lipids and SP-A is involved in organization of
	alveolar surfactant phospholipids. SP-B belongs to another family
	of proteins, which includes also lipid-interacting polypeptides with
	antibacterial and lytic properties. SP-B is a 17.4-kDa homodimer
	and each subunit contains three intrachain disulphides and has been
	proposed to contain four amphipathic helices oriented pairwise in
	an antiparallel fashion. SP-A, SP-B and SP-D all have been detected
	also in the gastrointestinal tract. SP-C, in contrast, appears to
	be a unique protein with extreme structural and stability properties
	and to exist exclusively in the lungs. SP-C is a lipopeptide containing
	covalently linked palmitoyl chains and is folded into a 3.7-nm alpha-helix
	with a central 2.3-nm all-aliphatic part, making it perfectly suited
	to interact in a transmembranous way with a fluid bilayer composed
	of dipalmitoylglycerophosphocholine, the main component of surfactant.
	Homozygous genetic deficiency of proSP-B causes lethal respiratory
	distress soon after birth and is associated with aberrant processing
	of the precursor of SP-C. This review focuses on the chemical composition,
	structures and interactions of the pulmonary surfactant, in particular
	the associated proteins.},

	dynamics in a semidilute polymer solution undergoing a steady, uniform
	shear flow. In the presence of the shear flow, the system used in
	the present study exhibits anisotropic structure factors, often referred
	to as butterfly patterns, which rotate with increasing shear rate
	[P. P. Jose and G. Szamel, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 114905 (2007)]. The
	rotation of these patterns correlates with shear thinning of the
	solution. In order to elucidate the microscopic origin of this behavior,
	we have investigated the change in the single-chain dynamics in the
	solution: We have focused on the relaxation of the end-to-end vector,
	the Rouse modes, and the radius of gyration tensor. In equilibrium
	and for small shear rates, these quantities show double exponential
	relaxation. With increasing shear rate, they show oscillatory relaxation,
	which hints at the tumbling motion of the chain. In the high shear
	rate regime, the frequency of the oscillations of the end-to-end
	vector autocorrelation function shows a power law dependence on the
	shear rate. We have compared the single-chain dynamics in the semidilute
	solution with that in a dilute solution. An analysis of the instantaneous
	values of the radius of gyration tensor, the end-to-end distance,
	and the normal stress along the system's trajectory reveals a synchronization
	of the fluctuations of these quantities. (C) 2008 American Institute

	a strongly bonded line of charged beads is similar to that of a single

  abstract = {Among the variety of roles for nanopores in biology, an important
	one is enabling polymer transport, for example in gene transfer between
	bacteria(1) and transport of RNA through the nuclear membrane(2).
	Recently, this has inspired the use of protein(3-5) and solid-state(6-10)
	nanopores as single-molecule sensors for the detection and structural
	analysis of DNA and RNA by voltage-driven translocation. The magnitude
	of the force involved is of fundamental importance in understanding
	and exploiting this translocation mechanism, yet so far it has remained
	unknown. Here, we demonstrate the first measurements of the force
	on a single DNA molecule in a solid-state nanopore by combining optical
	tweezers(11) with ionic-current detection. The opposing force exerted
	by the optical tweezers can be used to slow down and even arrest
	the translocation of the DNA molecules. We obtain a value of 0.24
	+/- 0.02 pN mV(-1) for the force on a single DNA molecule, independent
	of salt concentration from 0.02 to 1MKCl. This force corresponds
	to an effective charge of 0.50 +/- 0.05 electrons per base pair equivalent
	to a 75% reduction of the bare DNA charge.},

  abstract = {Using fluorescence microscopy, we compare the degree of adsorption
	and stretching of DNA onto surfaces achieved by published stretching
	methods that use fluid flow: molecular combing, spin-stretching,
	and air-blowing. Molecular combing uses a receding meniscus to stretch
	out and deposit the DNA onto a hydrophobic surface. In spin-stretching,
	we find that the effect of radial hydrodynamic flow created by the
	centrifugal force of the rotating disk is minimal and that the DNA
	is stretched out on a hydrophobic substrate by the moving meniscus.
	In air-blowing, a jet of gas pushes liquid across a substrate, depositing
	stretched DNA molecules along the way. In our study, DNA molecules
	either combed or spin-stretched onto hydrophobic surfaces stretch
	to a greater degree than those that are air-blown; fewer are deposited
	at pH 8.0 than at lower pH, apparently because at pH 8.0 DNA adhesion
	occurs primarily only at the DNA extremities and so avoids trapped
	regions of incompletely stretched DNA, with the side effect that
	more molecules avoid adhesion altogether. We find by high-speed video
	microscopy that there is complex droplet deformation and motion during
	air-blowing, which complicates the deposition and stretching process,
	leading to radial alignment. Our results are a first step toward
	understanding and optimizing the various proposed methods of DNA
	stretching and anchoring onto surfaces, which is important in studying
	their interactions with proteins.},

  abstract = {In a series of two papers, west tidy the onset of entanglements and
	the transition from Rouse-type to reptation dynamics, in the context
	of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations of a coarse-grained
	polymer melt. A set of monodisperse systems with increasing chain
	length is examined. We consider both static and dynamic aspects of
	the problem. Part I, the preceding paper (DOI: 10.1021/ma901131c),
	presents a topological analysis Of Our systems. It deals with the
	continuous transition from unentangled to entangled topology, as
	chain length increases, at the level of primitive paths (PPs). In
	part II, this paper, we present the dynamics of our systems, and
	a comparison between topological and dynamical analysis. We utilize
	a coarse-grained model of polyethylene, based oil the blob(or bead)
	picture of a polymer chain. The conservative potentials describing
	bead interactions are derived by a bottom-Lip approach. Each bead
	corresponds to 20 carbon atoms. Because of the large coarse-graining
	level, beads can easily overlap and chain contours can cross each
	other. We maintain chain uncrossability by introducing a segmental
	repulsive potential (SRP), adapted to our model. It is demonstrated
	that suitable parametrization of this potential can reproduce the
	dynamical transition from Rouse to reptation dynamics. For short
	chain unentangled systems, we observe a deviation from the pure Rouse
	behavior, attributed to the presence of chain stiffness, nonbonded
	interactions, and chain uncrossability, which are not considered
	by the Rouse model. For long chain systems, global dynamics is typical
	of reptation. The chain length dependence of viscosity and self-diffusion
	is described by power laws, with exponents equal to +3.2 and -2.3,
	respectively. A global and local (Rouse-mode) dynamical analysis,
	a static topological analysis, and the comparison between them, shows
	that topological constraints alter polymer dynamics at length scales
	much shorter than the length scales implied by the reptation model.
	This is evidenced by a slowing down of Rouse modes, which is maximum
	at the length scale where the underlying system of interpenetrating
	PPs appears is a network of topological constraints.},

  abstract = {End-grafted polymer chains exposed to strong shear solvent flow in
	the x-direction are investigated by a non-equilibrium Monte Carlo
	method using the bond-fluctuating model. The solvent flow is modelled
	by an enhanced jump rate of monomers in the Row direction. Under
	strong enough shear flow, the shear force is non-linear with the
	blob size xi depending on the shear force and not on the monomer
	volume fraction phi. For the case of a grafted single chain, our
	data on the end-to-end distance of the polymer for a wide range of
	shear rate gamma agree well with the proposed scaling form and compare
	reasonably well with the Langevin force law in the extreme strong
	shear case. Also the scaling for the blob size is derived with xi
	= aN(nu)K(gamma N2+nu) for some scaling function K, and verified
	by our simulation data. For the case of a polymer brush, we derive
	the crossover force scale F* separating the weak and strong shear
	regime with F*a/(kT) = phi(nu/(3 nu-1)) where nu is the usual self-avoiding
	walk exponent. For the case of a polymer brush under strong shear,
	the velocity profile, nu(z), inside and above the brush is calculated
	analytically by treating the flow as in a porous medium and solving
	the Brinkman equation. The solution of the velocity profile is then
	combined with non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation data which allow
	a self-consistent determination of the chain end-to-end length and
	the incline angle of the chain. Also we derive the scaling form for
	the positions x(n) of the nth monomer and verify it by our simulation
	data. We further obtain an analytical expression for x(n) in terms
	of the effective viscosity eta of the model, given by F = eta a nu(z).
	The effective viscosity is also found from our simulation to be eta
	a(2)/(kT) similar or equal to 0.02 +/- 0.005.},

	in continuous elongational flow offers compelling advantages for
	biotechnology applications such as DNA mapping. However, the polymer
	dynamics in common microfluidic implementations are typically complicated
	by shear interactions. These effects were investigated by observation
	of fluorescently labeled 185 kb bacterial artificial chromosomes
	in sudden mixed shear and elongational microflows generated in funneled
	microfluidic channels. The extension of individual free DNA molecules
	was studied as a function of accumulated fluid strain and strain
	rate. Under constant or gradually changing strain rate conditions,
	stretching by the sudden elongational component proceeded as previously
	described for an ideal elongational flow (T. T. Perkins, D. E. Smith
	and S. Chu, Science, 1997, 276, 2016): first, increased accumulated
	fluid strain and increased strain rate produced higher stretching
	efficiencies, despite the complications of shear interactions; and
	second, the results were consistent with unstretched molecules predominantly
	in hairpin conformations. More abrupt strain rate profiles did not
	deliver a uniform population of highly extended molecules, highlighting
	the importance of balance between shear and elongational components
	in the microfluidic environment for DNA stretching applications.
	DNA sizing with up to 10% resolution was demonstrated. Overall, the
	device delivered 1000 stretched DNA molecules per minute in a method
	compatible with diffraction-limited optical sequence motif mapping
	and without requiring laborious chemical modifications of the DNA
	or the chip surface. Thus, the method is especially well suited for
	genetic characterization of DNA mixtures such as in pathogen fingerprinting

	as well as Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of these flows. The
	bead-spring and bead-rod models are presented, the range of their

	interactions, excluded volume, and other physical effects within
	BD simulations. After reviewing and updating work in the linear viscoelastic

	While BD predictions of the conformations of 20 to 100 micron long
	DNA molecules in strong shear and extensional flows has been in good
	to excellent agreement with the corresponding experiments, predictions
	of the polystyrene dilute solution rheometry data have been hit or

	This may be due, in part, to the more important roles of hydrodynamic
	interactions and excluded volume interactions in the more flexible,

	effects in BD simulations has led to improved predictions, but does
	not lead to the accurate prediction of the plateau Trouton viscosity

	this paper we present a new boundary condition implementation that
	enables the simulation of flow through permeable boundaries in the
	Lagrangian mesh-free method, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH).
	Each permeable boundary is associated with an inflow or outflow zone
	outside the domain, in which particles are created or removed as
	required. The analytic boundary condition is applied by prescribing
	the appropriate variables for particles in an inflow or outflow zone,
	and extrapolating other variables from within the domain. Characteristic-based
	non-reflecting boundary conditions, described in the literature for
	mesh-based methods, can be implemented within this framework. Results
	are presented for simple one-dimensional flows, quasi-one-dimensional
	compressible nozzle flow, and two-dimensional flow around a cylinder
	at Reynolds numbers of 40 and 100 and a Mach number of 0.1. These

	indicating a more homogeneous ensemble of local environments. At
	even larger stresses, in the strain- hardening regime, mobility decreases

  abstract = {We consider the static and dynamical behavior of a flexible polymer
	chain under steady-state sedimentation using analytic arguments and
	computer simulations. The model system comprises a single coarse-grained
	polymer chain of N segments, which resides in a Newtonian fluid as
	described by the Navier-Stokes equations. The chain is driven into
	nonequilibrium steady state by gravity acting on each segment. The
	equations of motion for the segments and the Navier-Stokes equations
	are solved simultaneously using an immersed boundary method, where
	thermal fluctuations are neglected. To characterize the chain conformation,
	we consider its radius of gyration R-G(N). We find that the presence
	of gravity explicitly breaks the spatial symmetry leading to anisotropic
	scaling of the components of R-G with N along the direction of gravity
	R-G,R-parallel to and perpendicular to it R-G,R-perpendicular to,
	respectively. We numerically estimate the corresponding anisotropic
	scaling exponents nu(parallel to)approximate to 0.79 and nu(perpendicular
	to)approximate to 0.45, which differ significantly from the equilibrium
	scaling exponent nu(e)=0.588 in three dimensions. This indicates
	that on the average, the chain becomes elongated along the sedimentation
	direction for large enough N. We present a generalization of the
	Flory scaling argument, which is in good agreement with the numerical
	results. It also reveals an explicit dependence of the scaling exponents
	on the Reynolds number. To study the dynamics of the chain, we compute
	its effective diffusion coefficient D(N), which does not contain
	Brownian motion. For the range of values of N used here, we find
	that both the parallel and perpendicular components of D increase
	with the chain length N, in contrast to the case of thermal diffusion
	in equilibrium. This is caused by the fluid-driven fluctuations in
	the internal configuration of the polymer that are magnified as polymer
	size becomes larger.},

	models are investigated and compared with the MD results. The effective
	mean force field is computed as a function of the intercluster distance,

	systems within a wide density range but the radial distribution function

	coefficients for both models are computed directly from the time-correlation
	function of the random force field of the microscopic system. For
	high density or a large cluster size the friction force is overestimated
	and the diffusivity underestimated due to the omission of many-body
	effects as a result of the assumed pairwise form of the coarse-grained

  abstract = {Traditionally, microscopic fluctuations of molecules have been probed
	by measuring responses of an ensemble to perturbations. Now, single-molecule
	experiments are capable of following fluctuations without introducing
	perturbations. However, dynamics not readily sampled at equilibrium
	should be accessible to nonequilibrium single-molecule measurements.
	In a recent study [Qu, X. et a]. Proc. Nad. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008,
	105, 6602-6607], the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy
	transfer (FRET) between probes on the L18 loop and 3' terminus of
	the 260 nucleotide RNase P RNA from Bacillus stearothermophilus was
	found to exhibit complex kinetics that depended on the (periodically
	alternating) concentration of magnesium ions ([Mg2+]) in solution.
	Specifically, this time series was found to exhibit a quasi-periodic
	response to a square-wave pattern of [Mg2+] changes. Because these
	experiments directly probe only one of the many degrees of freedom
	in the macromolecule, models are needed to interpret these data.
	We find that Hidden Markov Models are inadequate for describing the
	nonequilibrium dynamics, but they serve as starting points for the
	construction of models in which a discrete observable degree of freedom
	is coupled to a continuously evolving (hidden) variable. Consideration
	of several models of this general form indicates that the quasi-periodic
	response in the, nonequilibrium experiments results from the switching
	(back and forth) in positions of the minima of the effective potential
	for the hidden variable. This switching drives oscillation of that
	variable and synchronizes the Population to the changing [Mg2+].
	We set the models in the context of earlier theoretical and experimental
	studies and conclude that single-molecule experiments with periodic
	peturbations can indeed yield qualitatively new information beyond
	that obtained at equilibrium.},

	and molecular scales. Using molecular-dynamics simulations, we study
	the critical size and find that the van der Waals force plays an
	important role in particle diffusion as the particle size approaches
	molecular scale. Due to the limitations of computing facilities,

	due to its potential to simulate the dynamics of colloidal particles
	in fluidic devices. In this work, we explore the validity of DPD
	to reproduce the hydrodynamic interaction between a suspended particle
	and confining solid walls. We first show that a relatively large
	Schmidt number of the DPD fluid can be obtained by increasing the
	ratio between the strength of the dissipative force and the kinetic
	energy of the particles. We then measure the mobility and diffusion
	coefficient of the colloidal particles and show good agreement with
	the predicted results. We then focus on the particle-solid interactions
	and measure the force on a colloidal particle moving both parallel
	and perpendicular to two parallel walls. In both cases we found good
	agreement with the theoretical predictions based on Stokes flows
	for separations as small as one-tenth of the particle radius. (C)

	functionality and integrated documentation. All binary files are
	independent of hardware endian and can be read by versions of GROMACS
	compiled using different floating-point precision. A large collection

  abstract = {The longest relaxation times of polymer Solutions of semi-flexible
	T4 DNA and flexible 18 M molar mass polyacrylamide (PAAm) in dilute
	and semi-dilute concentration range are studied by the polymer extension
	relaxation of stretched single DNA molecules and by the stress relaxation
	of PAAm solutions measurements. For both polymer solutions, the longest
	relaxation time normalized by the value at infinite dilution with
	the same solvent viscosity tau/tau(0) increases with increasing concentration.
	In the dilute regime, the longest relaxation time increases just
	slightly with increasing concentration as tau/tau(0)=[1 + cA - root
	2(cA)(1.5) + 2(cA)(2)] as well as the empirical relation of tau/tau(0)=exp(cA)
	up to c similar to 3c* with A approximate to 0.5[eta], where c* is
	the overlap concentration, in accord with the theory and previous
	experiments. For the semi-dilute solutions, the scaling of tau/tau(0)
	with concentration shows two different exponents in two concentration
	regions, corresponding to the unentangled and entangled regimes.
	The exponents are consistent with those expected by the theory of
	dynamical scaling for semi-dilute polymer solutions. The crossover
	concentration from the unentangled to entangled regime c(e) is found
	to be similar to 9c* in a good solvent, in accord with other experiments
	based on the relaxation of a single molecule, the diffusion coefficient,
	and the solution viscosity measurements. We also test the universality
	of the concentration dependence of the longest relaxation time for
	both flexible and semi-flexible polymers in both good and Theta solvents
	in the dilute and semi-dilute regimes by analyzing literature data

  abstract = {Functionalized nanopores have been used recently for the detection

	is used to elucidate critical interrelationships between physical
	properties of the nanopore, electric field strength, and translocation
	kinetics. We report a nonlinear increase in DNA translocation speed

	in flow and can be much larger than the size of the polymer molecule.
	The transient development of this depletion layer is also studied,

	Stretched chains can be understood as Rouse chains of impenetrable

	that isolate a single biomolecule, which then provides multiple binding
	sites for ligands. The captured complex may be subjected to a spectrum
	of forces, inhibiting or facilitating ligand activity. In the following
	experiments, we utilize optical tweezers to characterize and quantify
	DNA binding of various ligands. High mobility group type B (HMGB)
	proteins, which bind to double-stranded DNA, are shown to serve the
	dual purpose of stabilizing and enhancing the flexibility of double
	stranded DNA. Unusual intercalating ligands are observed to thread
	into and lengthen the double-stranded structure. Proteins binding
	to both double- and single-stranded DNA, such as the alpha polymerase
	subunit of E. coli Pol III, are characterized, and the subdomains
	containing the distinct sites responsible-for binding are isolated.
	Finally, DNA binding of bacteriophage T4 and T7 single-stranded DNA
	(ssDNA) binding proteins is measured for a range of salt concentrations,
	illustrating a binding model for proteins that slide along double-stranded
	DNA, ultimately binding tightly to ssDNA. These recently developed
	methods quantify both the binding activity of the ligand as well

  abstract = {This paper is motivated by experiments in which time series of tracer
	particles in viscoelastic liquids are recorded using advanced microscopy.
	The experiments seek to infer either viscoelastic properties of the
	sample [Mason and Weitz, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 1250-1253 (1995)] or
	diffusive properties of the specific tracer particle in the host
	medium [Suh et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 57, 63-78 (2005); Matsui
	et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 103, 18131-18136 (2006);
	Lai et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 104, 1482-1487 (2007);
	Fricks et al., SIAM J. Appl. Math. 69, 1277-1308 (2009)]. Our focus
	is the latter. Experimentalists often fit data to transient anomalous
	diffusion: a sub-diffusive power law scaling (t(v), with 0 < v <
	1) of mean-squared displacement (MSD) over a finite time interval,
	with longtime viscous scaling (t(1)). The time scales of sub-diffusion
	and exponents v are observed to vary with particle size, particle
	surface chemistry, and viscoelastic properties of the host material.
	Until now, explicit models for transient sub-diffusive MSD scaling
	behavior [Doi and Edwards, The Theory of Polymer Physics (Oxford
	University Press, New York, 1986); Kremer and Grest, J. Chem. Phys.
	92, 5057-5086 (1990); Rubinstein and Colby, Polymer Physics (Oxford
	University Press, New York, 2003)] are limited to precisely three
	exponents: monomer diffusion in Rouse chain melts (t(1/2)), in Zimm
	chain solutions (t(2/3)), and in reptating chains (t(1/4)). In this
	paper, we present an explicit parametrized family of stochastic processes
	(generalized Langevin equations with prescribed memory kernels) and
	derive their closed-form solutions which (1) span the complete range
	of transient sub-diffusive behavior and (2) possess the flexibility
	to tune both the time window of sub-diffusive scaling and the power
	law exponent v. These results establish a robust family of sub-diffusive
	models, for which the inverse problem of parameter inference from
	experimental data [Fricks et al., SIAM J. Appl. Math. 69, 1277-1308
	(2009)] remains to be developed. (C) 2009 The Society of Rheology.

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in simulating
	dynamical phenomena of multiscale systems. This was brought about
	in large part by the ever growing field of nanotechnology, in which
	nanodevices are often part of larger systems. Molecular Dynamics
	(MD) provides a valuable tool for modeling systems at the nanoscale.
	However, the atomistic modeling of macroscopic problems is still
	beyond the reach of current MD simulations due to their prohibitive
	computational requirements. The development of hybrid techniques
	that combine continuum and atomistic descriptions can alleviate such
	limitations. This can be accomplished by limiting the use of MD to
	regions where the atomistic scales need to be resolved, while using
	a continuum-based solver for the remainder of the domain. The computational
	savings of such a formulation will strongly depend on the relative
	size of the MD region to that of the continuum, and the extent of
	the overlap where information is exchanged between the two subdomains.
	Such methods are crucial for the proficient advancement and better
	understanding of nanodevices interacting with microscale systems.
	In this article, an account of the development of hybrid atomistic-continuum
	(HAC) models for dense flows is presented. The focus is on domain-decomposition-based
	HAC models. Here, the domain is divided into a relatively small region
	where atomistic details are important, and a larger region where
	the continuum description of the fluid is applicable. Of primary
	concern is how to accurately couple the atomistic and continuum domains,
	a challenge that manifests itself in the imposition of boundary conditions
	in an internally consistent manner. Two main approaches: state variable
	(Dirichlet), and flux-exchange schemes are analyzed and compared.
	A review of some applications utilizing such HAC models is also provided.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with approximating arbitrarily shaped boundaries
	in SPH simulations. We model the boundaries by means of boundary
	particles which exert forces on a fluid. We show that, when these
	forces are chosen correctly, and the boundary particle spacing is
	a factor of 2 (or more) less than the fluid particle spacing, the
	total boundary force on a fluid SPH particle is perpendicular to
	boundaries with negligible error. Furthermore, the variation in the
	force as a fluid particle moves, while keeping a fixed distance from
	the boundary, is also negligible. The method works equally well for
	convex or concave boundaries. The new boundary forces simplify SPH
	algorithms and are superior to other methods for simulating complicated
	boundaries. We apply the new method to (a) the rise of a cylinder
	contained in a curved basin, (b) the spin down of a fluid in a cylinder,
	and (c) the oscillation of a cylinder inside a larger fixed cylinder.
	The results of the simulations are in good agreement with those obtained
	using other methods, but with the advantage that they are very simple

  abstract = {Tailoring surface interactions or grafting of polymers onto surfaces
	is a versatile tool for controlling wettability, lubrication, adhesion
	and interactions between surfaces. Using molecular dynamics of a
	coarse-grained, bead-spring model and dynamic single-chain-in-mean-field
	simulations, we investigate how structural changes near the surface
	affect the flow of a polymer melt over the surface and how these
	changes can be parameterized by a hydrodynamic boundary condition.
	We study the temperature dependence of the near-surface flow of a
	polymer melt at a corrugated, attractive surface. At weakly attractive
	surfaces, lubrication layers form, the slip length is large and increases
	upon cooling. Close to the glass transition temperature, very large
	slip lengths are observed. At a more attractive surface, a 'sticky
	surface layer' is build up, giving rise to a small slip length. Upon
	cooling, the slip length decreases at high temperatures, passes through
	a minimum and increases upon approaching the glass transition temperature.
	At strongly attractive surfaces, the Navier slip condition fails
	to describe Couette and Poiseuille flows simultaneously. A similar
	failure of the Navier slip condition is observed for the flow of
	a polymer melt over a brush comprised of identical molecules. The
	wetting and flow properties of this surface are rather complex. Most
	notably, the cyclic motion of the grafted molecules gives rise to
	a reversal of the flow direction at the grafting surface. The failure
	of the Navier slip condition in both cases can be rationalized within
	a schematic, two-layer model, which demonstrates that the Navier
	slip condition fails to simultaneously describe Poiseuille and Couette
	flow if the fluid at the surface exhibits a higher viscosity than
	the bulk.},

	analyzing conformations of molecules. This is done by the application
	of self-organizing maps, i.e., a neural network type approach. Such
	an approach can be used to guide the selection of the relevant degrees
	of freedom. Then, we discuss technical issues related to the popular
	dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. Importantly, the potentials
	derived using the inverse Monte Carlo method can be used together
	with the DPD thermostat. In the final part we focus on solvent-free
	modeling which offers a different route to coarse graining by integrating

  abstract = {A most promising off-lattice technique in order to simulate not only
	static but in addition dynamic behavior of linear and star-branched
	chains is the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. In this
	model the atomistic representation of polymer molecules is replaced
	by a (coarse-grained) equivalent chain consisting of beads which
	are repulsive for each other in order to mimic the excluded volume
	effect (successive beads in addition are linked by springs). Likewise
	solvent molecules are combined to beads which in turn are repulsive
	for each other as well as for the polymer segments. The system is
	relaxed by molecular dynamics solving Newton's laws under the influence
	of short ranged conservative forces (i.e., repulsion between nonbonded
	beads and a proper balance of repulsion and attraction between bonded
	segments) and dissipative forces due to friction between particles,
	the latter representing the thermostat in conjunction with proper
	random forces. A variation of the strength of the repulsion between
	different types of beads allows the simulation of any desired thermodynamic
	situation. Static and dynamic properties of isolated linear and star-branched
	chains embedded in athermal, exothermal, and endothermal solvent
	are presented and theta conditions are examined. The generally accepted
	scaling concept for athermal systems is fairly well reproduced by
	linear and star-branched DPD chains and theta conditions appear for
	a unique parameter independent of functionality as in the case of
	Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the correspondence between
	DPD and Monte Carlo data referring to the shape of chains and stars
	is fairly well, too. For dilute solutions the Zimm behavior is expected
	for dynamic properties which is indeed realized in DPD systems. (C)

  abstract = {Three coarse-grained molecular dynamics models of the double-stranded
	DNA are proposed and compared in the context of single molecule mechanical
	manipulation such as twisting and various schemes of stretching-unzipping,
	shearing, two-strand stretching and stretching of only one strand.
	The models differ in the number of effective beads (between two and
	five) representing each nucleotide. They all show similar behaviour,
	but the bigger the resolution, the more details in the force patterns.
	The models incorporate the effective Lennard-Jones potentials in
	the couplings between two strands and harmonic potentials to describe
	the structure of a single strand. The force patterns are shown to
	depend on the sequence studied. In particular, both shearing and
	unzipping for an all-AT sequence lead to lower forces than for an
	all-CG sequence. The unzipping patterns and the corresponding scenario
	diagrams for the contact rupture events are found to reflect the
	sequential information if the temperature is moderate and initial
	transients are discarded. The derived torque-force phase diagram
	is found to be qualitatively consistent with experiments and all-atom

  abstract = {In condensed polymeric liquids confined in slit channels, the movement
	of chains is constrained by two factors: entanglement among the chains
	and the excluded volume between the chains and the wall. In this
	study, we propose a wall boundary (WB) model for the primitive chain
	network (PCN) model, which describes the dynamics of polymer chains
	in bulk based on coarse graining upon the characteristic molecular
	weight of the entanglement. The proposed WB model is based on the
	assumptions that (i) polymers are not stuck but simply reflected
	randomly by the wall, and (ii) subchains below the entanglement length
	scale behave like those in bulk even near the wall. Using the WB
	model, we simulate the dynamics of entangled polymer chains confined
	in slit channels. The results show that as the slit narrows, the
	chains are compressed in the direction normal to the wall, while
	they are expanded in the parallel direction. In addition, the relaxation
	time of the end-to-end vector increases, and the diffusivity of the
	center of mass decreases. The compression in the normal direction
	is a natural effect of confinement, while the expansion is introduced
	by a hooking process near the wall. The trends revealed that the
	relaxation time and diffusivity depend on the increase in friction
	due to an increased number of entanglements near the wall, which
	is also associated with the hooking process in the PCN model. These
	results are expected within the assumptions of the PCN model. Thus,
	the proposed WB model can successfully reproduce the effects of wall
	confinement on chains.},

  abstract = {We describe in detail how to implement a coarse-grained hybrid molecular
	dynamics and stochastic rotation dynamics simulation technique that
	captures the combined effects of Brownian and hydrodynamic forces
	in colloidal suspensions. The importance of carefully tuning the
	simulation parameters to correctly resolve the multiple time and
	length scales of this problem is emphasized. We systematically analyze
	how our coarse-graining scheme resolves dimensionless hydrodynamic
	numbers such as the Reynolds number Re, which indicates the importance
	of inertial effects, the Schmidt number Sc, which indicates whether
	momentum transport is liquidlike or gaslike, the Mach number, which
	measures compressibility effects, the Knudsen number, which describes
	the importance of noncontinuum molecular effects, and the Peclet
	number, which describes the relative effects of convective and diffusive
	transport. With these dimensionless numbers in the correct regime
	the many Brownian and hydrodynamic time scales can be telescoped
	together to maximize computational efficiency while still correctly
	resolving the physically relevant processes. We also show how to
	control a number of numerical artifacts, such as finite-size effects
	and solvent-induced attractive depletion interactions. When all these
	considerations are properly taken into account, the measured colloidal
	velocity autocorrelation functions and related self-diffusion and
	friction coefficients compare quantitatively with theoretical calculations.
	By contrast, these calculations demonstrate that, notwithstanding
	its seductive simplicity, the basic Langevin equation does a remarkably
	poor job of capturing the decay rate of the velocity autocorrelation
	function in the colloidal regime, strongly underestimating it at
	short times and strongly overestimating it at long times. Finally,
	we discuss in detail how to map the parameters of our method onto
	physical systems and from this extract more general lessons-keeping
	in mind that there is no such thing as a free lunch-that may be relevant
	for other coarse-graining schemes such as lattice Boltzmann or dissipative

	particles provided that the conservative repulsive force is appropriately
	chosen. The suspension model is further improved with a new formulation,
	which augments standard DPD with noncentral dissipative shear forces
	between particles while preserving angular momentum. Using the new
	DPD formulation we investigate the rheology, microstructure and shear-induced
	migration of a monodisperse suspension of colloidal particles in
	plane shear flows (Couette and Poiseuille). Specifically, to achieve
	a well-dispersed suspension we employ exponential conservative forces
	for the colloid-colloid and colloid-solvent interactions but keep
	the conventional linear force for the solvent-solvent interactions.
	Our Simulations yield relative Viscosity Versus volume fraction predictions
	ill good agreement with both experimental data and empirical correlations.
	We also Compute the shear-dependent viscosity and the first and second
	normal-stress differences and coefficients in both Couette and Poiseuille
	flow. Simulations near the close packing volume-fraction (64%) at
	low shear rates demonstrate a transition to flow-induced string-like
	structures of colloidal particles simultaneously with a transition
	to a nonlinear Couette velocity profile in agreement with experimental
	observations. After a sufficient increase of the shear rate the ordered
	structure melts into disorder with restoration of the linear velocity
	profile. Migration effects simulated in Poiseuille now compare well
	with experiments and model predictions. The important role of angular
	momentum and torque in nondilute suspensions is also demonstrated
	when compared with simulations by the standard DPD, which omits the
	angular degrees of freedom. Overall, the new method agrees very well
	with the Stokesian Dynamics method but it seems to have lower computational
	complexity and is applicable to general complex fluids systems.},

  abstract = {In this work we compare and characterize the behavior of Langevin
	and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) thermostats in a broad range
	of nonequilibrium simulations of polymeric systems. Polymer brushes
	in relative sliding motion, polymeric liquids in Poiseuille and Couette
	flows, and brush-melt interfaces are used as model systems to analyze
	the efficiency and limitations of different Langevin and DPD thermostat
	implementations. Widely used coarse-grained bead-spring models under
	good and poor solvent conditions are employed to assess the effects
	of the thermostats. We considered equilibrium, transient, and steady
	state examples for testing the ability of the thermostats to maintain
	constant temperature and to reproduce the underlying physical phenomena
	in nonequilibrium situations. The common practice of switching off
	the Langevin thermostat in the flow direction is also critically
	revisited. The efficiency of different weight functions for the DPD
	thermostat is quantitatively analyzed as a function of the solvent
	quality and the nonequilibrium situation.},

  abstract = {We present a comparative study of two computer simulation methods
	to obtain static and dynamic properties of dilute polymer solutions.
	The first approach is a recently established hybrid algorithm based
	on dissipative coupling between molecular dynamics and lattice Boltzmann
	(LB), while the second is standard Brownian dynamics (BD) with fluctuating
	hydrodynamic interactions. Applying these methods to the same physical
	system (a single polymer chain in a good solvent in thermal equilibrium)
	allows us to draw a detailed and quantitative comparison in terms
	of both accuracy and efficiency. It is found that the static conformations
	of the LB model are distorted when the box length L is too small
	compared to the chain size. Furthermore, some dynamic properties
	of the LB model are subject to an L-1 finite-size effect, while the
	BD model directly reproduces the asymptotic L ->infinity behavior.
	Apart from these finite-size effects, it is also found that in order
	to obtain the correct dynamic properties for the LB simulations,
	it is crucial to properly thermalize all the kinetic modes. Only
	in this case, the results are in excellent agreement with each other,
	as expected. Moreover, Brownian dynamics is found to be much more
	efficient than lattice Boltzmann as long as the degree of polymerization
	is not excessively large. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

	linear stochastic differential equations. Based on Fourier analyses,
	we calculate the mean square displacement (MSD) of the particle motion,
	the key observable in the experiment. We obtain for both models the
	short-time asymptotics for the: MSD, as well as the long-time behavior
	in terms of the smallest non-zero eigenvalues. It is shown that:
	(i) the long-time dynamics of continuous elastic string model quantitatively
	agree with that of the discrete bead-spring model. (ii) The short-time
	MSD of both models are controlled by the tethered particle, with
	linear dependence on t. (iii) The two models show characteristic

  abstract = {Ion distributions and velocity profiles for electroosmotic flow in
	nanochannels of different widths are studied in this paper using
	molecular dynamics and continuum theory. For the various channel
	widths studied in this paper, the ion distribution near the channel
	wall is strongly influenced by the finite size of the ions and the
	discreteness of the solvent molecules. The classical Poisson-Boltzmann
	equation fails to predict the ion distribution near the channel wall
	as it does not account for the molecular aspects of the ion-wall
	and ion-solvent interactions. A modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation
	based on electrochemical potential correction is introduced to account
	for ion-wall and ion-solvent interactions. The electrochemical potential
	correction term is extracted from the ion distribution in a smaller
	channel using molecular dynamics. Using the electrochemical potential
	correction term extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
	of electroosmotic flow in a 2.22 nm channel, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann
	equation predicts the ion distribution in larger channel widths (e.g.,
	3.49 and 10.00 nm) with good accuracy. Detailed studies on the velocity
	profile in electro-osmotic flow indicate that the continuum flow
	theory can be used to predict bulk fluid flow in channels as small
	as 2.22 nm provided that the viscosity variation near the channel
	wall is taken into account. We propose a technique to embed the velocity
	near the channel wall obtained from MD simulation of electroosmotic
	flow in a narrow channel (e.g., 2.22 nm wide channel) into simulation
	of electroosmotic flow in larger channels. Simulation results indicate
	that such an approach can predict the velocity profile in larger
	channels (e.g., 3.49 and 10.00 nm) very well. Finally, simulation
	of electroosmotic flow in a 0.95 nm channel indicates that viscosity
	cannot be described by a local, linear constitutive relationship
	that the continuum flow theory is built upon and thus the continuum
	flow theory is not applicable for electroosmotic flow in such small
	channels. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {A truncation error analysis has been developed for the approximation
	of spatial derivatives in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and
	related first-order consistent methods such as the first-order form
	of the reproducing kernel particle method. Error is shown to depend
	on both the smoothing length It and the ratio of particle spacing
	to smoothing length, Delta x/h. For uniformly spaced particles in
	one dimension, analysis shows that as h is reduced while maintaining
	constant Delta x/h, error decays as h(2) until a limiting discretization
	error is reached, which is independent of h. If Delta x/h is reduced
	while maintaining constant h (i.e. if the number of neighbours per
	particle is increased), error decreases at a rate which depends on
	the kernel function's smoothness. When particles are distributed
	nonuniformly, error can grow as h is reduced with constant Delta
	x/h. First-order consistent methods are shown to remove this divergent
	behaviour. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical analysis
	for one dimension, and indicate that the main results are also true
	in three dimensions. This investigation highlights the complexity
	of error behaviour in SPH, and shows that the roles of both h and
	Delta x/h must be considered when choosing particle distributions

  abstract = {Static properties of a single polymer fixed at one end and subjected
	to a uniform how field are investigated for several polymer models:
	the Gaussian chain, the freely jointed chain, and the FENE (Finitely
	Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) chain. By taking into account first
	the excluded-volume interaction and subsequently also the hydrodynamic
	interaction, the polymer models are gradually completed and the relevance
	of each effect for the polymer deformation can be identified. Results
	from computer simulations of these bead spring chains are compared
	with analytical calculations using either the conformational distribution
	function or blob models. To this end, in contrast to the blob model
	with non-draining blobs introduced for a tethered polymer by Brochard-Wyart,
	we here develop also a model with free-draining blobs. It turns out
	that a limited extensibility of the polymer - described by nonlinear
	spring forces in the model - leads to a flow velocity dependence
	of the end-to-end distance, segment density, etc. which agrees with
	the power law predictions of the blob model only for very long chains
	and in a narrow range of flow velocities. This result is important,
	for comparison with recent experiments on DNA molecules which turn
	out to be still rather short in this respect. The relative importance
	of finite extensibility, the excluded-volume effect, and hydrodynamic
	interactions for polymers in how is not fully understood at present.
	The simulation of reasonably long chains becomes possible even when
	fluctuating hydrodynamic interactions are taken into account without
	employing averaging procedures by introducing efficient numerical
	approximation schemes. At medium velocity of the uniform flow the
	polymer is partially uncoiled and simulations show that the effects
	of excluded-volume and hydrodynamic interactions are position-dependent.
	Both are stronger near the free end than near the tethered end of
	the polymer. A crossover from a nearly non-draining polymer at small
	flow velocities to a free-draining almost uncoiled chain at large
	velocities is found in the simulations. Accordingly models assuming
	the polymer to be composed of either free- or non-draining subunits,
	like the two blob models, cannot correctly describe the extension
	and shape of a tethered polymer in flow, and simple power laws for
	the polymer extension, etc. cannot be expected.},

	models including a finite extensibility of the springs as well as
	excluded volume and hydrodynamic interactions between the beads have
	been performed. Complete spectra of relaxation times as well as corresponding
	relaxation modes are obtained from the simulation data by applying
	the static dynamics formalism, which rigorously describes the initial
	decay of correlations between the bead positions. As shown here,
	this procedure amounts to using a generalized Rouse-Zimm-like model
	which is governed by linear effective equations of motion having
	the same initial decay of correlations as the full nonlinear bead-spring
	model used in the simulations. In thermal equilibrium, the well-known
	scaling laws in the presence of excluded volume and hydrodynamic
	interactions between the beads are recovered, but, in addition, the
	static dynamics method also yields numeric values for the nonuniversal
	prefactors of the respective laws. The method is equally applicable
	to a broad range of problems, where the polymer is deformed by the
	action of flows or forces. Two examples of recent interest are considered:
	a tethered polymer pulled at its free end and one which is stretched
	by a uniform flow. It is shown that in both cases, the relaxation

	is investigated upon application of electrical fields of different
	strengths. The slit dimensions are 20 nm in height, 3 mu m in width,

	move fluently through the slits, while at higher electrical fields,

  abstract = {Extensive experimental work on the response of DNA molecules to externally
	applied forces and on the dynamics of DNA molecules flowing in microchannels
	and nanochannels has been carried out over the past two decades,
	however, there has not been available, until now, any atomic-scale
	means of analyzing nonequilibrium DNA response dynamics. There has
	not therefore been any way to investigate how the backbone and side-chain
	atoms along the length of a DNA molecule interact with the molecules
	and ions of the flowing solvent and with the atoms of passing boundary
	surfaces. We report here on the application of the nonequilibrium
	biomolecular dynamics simulation method that we developed [G. M.
	Wang and W. C. Sandberg, Nanotechnology 18, 4819 (2007)] to analyze,
	at the atomic interaction force level, the conformational dynamics
	of short-chain single-stranded DNA molecules in a shear flow near
	a surface. This is a direct atomic computational analysis of the
	hydrodynamic interaction between a biomolecule and a flowing solvent.
	The DNA molecules are observed to exhibit conformational behaviors
	including coils, hairpin loops, and figure-eight shapes that have
	neither been previously measured experimentally nor observed computationally,
	as far as we know. We relate the conformational dynamics to the atomic
	interaction forces experienced throughout the length of a molecule
	as it moves in the flowing solvent past the surface boundary. We
	show that the DNA conformational dynamics is related to the asymmetry
	in the molecular environment induced by the motion of the surrounding
	molecules and the atoms of the passing surface. We also show that
	while the asymmetry in the environment is necessary, it is not sufficient
	to produce the observed conformational dynamics. A time variation
	in the asymmetry, due in our case to a shear flow, must also exist.
	In order to contrast these results with the usual experimental situation
	of purely diffusive motion in thermal equilibrium we have also carried
	out computations with a zero shear rate. We show that in thermal
	equilibrium there is asymmetry and an atomic hydrodynamic coupling
	between DNA molecules and the solvent molecules but there is no coil-uncoil

	library, based on a unifying particle formulation for the simulation
	of continuous systems. In this formulation, the grid-free character
	of particle methods is relaxed by the introduction of a mesh for
	the reinitialization of the particles, the computation of the field
	equations, and the discretization of differential operators. The
	present utilization of the mesh does not detract from the adaptivity,
	the efficient handling of complex geometries, the minimal dissipation,
	and the good stability properties of particle methods. The coexistence
	of meshes and particles, allows for the development of a consistent
	and adaptive numerical method, but it presents a set of challenging
	parallelization issues that have hindered in the past the broader
	use of particle methods. The present library solves the key parallelization
	issues involving particle-mesh interpolations and the balancing of
	processor particle loading, using a novel adaptive tree for mixed
	domain decompositions along with a coloring scheme for the particle-mesh
	interpolation. The high parallel efficiency of the library is demonstrated
	in a series of benchmark tests on distributed memory and on a shared-memory
	vector architecture. The modularity of the method is shown by a range
	of simulations, from compressible vortex rings using a novel formulation
	of smooth particle hydrodynamics, to simulations of diffusion in
	real biological cell organelles. The present library enables large
	scale simulations of diverse physical problems using adaptive particle
	methods and provides a computational tool that is a viable alternative
	to mesh-based methods.},

	both in series and in parallel, through ultrathin (to <7 nm) molecular
	conduits formed by appositions of unit bubbles of alveolar gas. The
	ASN is the analogue of foam in vitro. Appositions of unit bubble
	films, namely foam films, include (a) bubble-to-bubble at the alveolar
	entrance, across alveolar ducts, and at pores of Kohn ([`]classical
	foam films'); (b) bubble-to-epithelial cell surface ([`]cell-surface
	foam film'); and (c) bubble-to-open surface liquid layer of the terminal
	conducting airways ([`]surface foam film'). These appositions of
	monolayer bubble films create (a) [`]macrochannels' ([`]pressure
	points', [`]reservoirs') that modulate ASL transfers, volume and
	flow throughout the acinus and between acinar surface and both the
	interstitium and the terminal conducting airways surfaces, and (b)
	[`]microchannels' along the broadest surfaces of the appositions.
	[`]Microchannels', which are expectedly bilayer, serve several functions,
	including (a) virtually frictionless orientation of unit bubbles
	and ASL to fill the acinar air space; (b) virtually unrestricted
	diffusion of respiratory gases; (c) architectural support ([`]infrastructure')

	between acinar ASN and the bubble-free open liquid surfaces of the

	as outlined above in all regions of the lung, at all lung volumes,
	beginning at the onset of air-breathing at birth and continuing throughout
	life. Reports of its discovery (Pulmonary Physiology of the Fetus,
	Newborn and Child (1975) 116; Pediatr. Res. 12 (1978) 1070) and subsequent
	confirmatory research including the adult lung are summarized in
	this review by progressive development of each function. These functions,
	which are normal for a relatively dry foam such as the ASN (where
	gas:liquid volume ratio is >99:1) cannot be duplicated by the conventional
	theories and models of an open [`]alveolar lining layer'. The unfortunate
	research technologies upon which these theories and models have been
	formulated have, indeed, obfuscated recognition of the ASN in vivo.

  abstract = {It is generally held that the terminal lung unit (TLU) is an agglomeration
	of alveoli that opens into the branching air spaces of respiratory
	bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs and that these structures
	are covered by a continuous thin liquid layer bearing a monomolecular
	film of surfactants at the open gas-liquid interface. The inherent
	structural and functional instability given TLUs by a broad liquid
	surface layer of this nature has been mitigated by the discovery
	that the TLU surface is in fact an agglomeration of bubbles, a foam
	(the alveolar surface network) that fills the TLU space and forms
	ultrathin foam films that 1) impart infrastructural stability to
	sustain aeration, 2) modulate circulation of surface liquid, both
	in series and in parallel, throughout the TLU and between TLUs and
	the liquid surface of conducting airways, 3) modulate surface liquid
	volume and exchange with interstitial liquid, and 4) sustain gas
	transfer between conducting airways and pulmonary capillaries throughout
	the respiratory cycle. The experimental evidence, from discovery
	to the present, is addressed in this report.Lungs were examined in
	thorax by stereomicroscopy immediately from the in vivo state at
	volumes ranging from functional residual capacity to maximal volume
	(Vmax). Lungs were then excised; bubble topography of all anterior
	and anterolateral surfaces was reaffirmed and also confirmed for
	all posterior and posterolateral surfaces. The following additional
	criteria verify the ubiquitous presence of normal intraalveolar bubbles.
	1) Bubbles are absent in conducting airways. 2) Bubbles are stable
	and stationary in TLUs but can be moved individually by gentle microprobe
	pressure. 3) Adjoining bubbles move into the external medium through
	subpleural microincisions; there is no free gas, and vacated spaces
	are rendered airless. Adjacent bubbles may shift position in situ,
	while more distal bubbles remain stationary. 4) The position and
	movement of ldquolargerdquo bubbles identifies them as intraductal
	bubbles. 5) Transection of the lung reveals analogous bubble occurrence
	and history in central lung regions. 6) Bubbles become fixed in place
	and change shape when the lung is dried in air; the original shape
	and movement are restored when the lung is rewet. 7) All exteriorized
	bubbles are stable with lamellar (film) surface tension near zero.
	8) Intact lungs prepared and processed by the new double-embedding
	technique reveal the intact TLU bubbles and bubble films. Lungs were
	also monitored directly by stereomicroscopy to establish their presence,
	transformations, and apparent function from birth through adulthood,
	as summarized in the following section.Anatomy: Intraalveolar bubbles
	and bubble films (the unit structures of the alveolar surface network)
	have been found in all mammalian species examined to date, including
	lambs, kids, and rabbit pups and adult mice, rats, rabbits, cats,
	and pigs. Rabbits were used for the definitive studies. 1) A unit
	bubble occupies each alveolus and branching airway of the TLU; unit
	bubbles in clusters correspond with alveolar clusters. 2) The appositions
	of unit bubble lamellae (films) form a network of liquid channels
	within the TLUs. The appositions are bubble to bubble (near alveolar
	entrances, at pores of Kohn, and between ductal bubbles), bubble
	to epithelial cell surface, and bubble to surface liquid of conducting
	airways. They rapidly form stable Newtonian black foam films (sim7
	nm thick) under hydrodynamic conditions expected in vivo. 3) Lamellae
	of the foam films and bubbles tend to exclude bulk liquid and thus
	maintain near-zero surface tension. At the same time, the foam film
	formations-abetted by the constant but small retractive force of
	tissue recoil-stabilize unit bubble position within the network.
	4) Unit bubble mobility in response to applied force increases as
	liquid accumulates within the network (e.g., in excised lungs or
	(in extremis) pulmonary edema) to produce reversible foam film transformations
	(Newtonian black &rlarr2; common &rlarr2; thin liquid). 5) Free (bulk)
	liquid is normally present at Plateau borders of the foam films and
	over crevices in the epithelial cell surface (the pressure points).
	6) Thus, the network is both a continuous liquid circulation within
	foam film channels and a gas phase within the lamellae of unit bubbles.
	7) Both foam films and their constituent bubble films are deformed
	and destroyed by the usual laboratory methods of lung degassing and
	tissue processing for light and electron microscopy. However, they
	can be preserved in the fresh lung by aldehyde fixation alone and
	by a new double-embedding method.Physiology: 1) Bubble formation
	and lamellar appositions originate in previously airless units to
	form, re-form, and repair the network. Formation mechanisms include
	gas dispersion in liquid and liquid drainage from microdroplets.
	2) The essential substrates are components of the lung surfactant
	system. 3) Both unit and collective (i.e., network) bubbles provide
	the infrastructural support that sustains alveolar and ductal aeration.
	4) Network formation is the indispensable process for transition
	from the fetal aqueous to the neonatal aerial environment. Surfactant-poor,
	bubble-free immature lungs fail this transition without therapy (e.g.,
	instillation or aerosol delivery of surfactant to induce bubble formation).
	5) The network, from birth to adulthood, modulates gas, liquid, and
	solute balance at the TLU surfaces. It minimizes liquid content of
	the gas-permeable lamellae (black films) in the path of respiratory
	gas exchanges. At the pressure points, it is a reservoir for liquid
	and solute exchanges within the network and with the septal interstitium
	and liquid surface of conducting airways. 6) Fluidity of unit structures
	of the network is a fundamental characteristic of TLU mechanics that
	underlies the independence of unit structure and consequent local
	modulation of gas and liquid transfers, the modest force requirement
	to effect volume change in the normal breathing range, the virtual
	exclusion of liquid from interfacial lamellae to establish near-zero
	surface tension in this range, the reentry of liquid at high volumes
	(&gt;sim80% Vmax), the formation of surpellic films that resist collapse
	at the lowest volumes, the formation of new bubbles in previously
	airless units, the formation of new bubbles in units with preexisting
	bubbles, and the virtually frictionless movement of newly formed
	bubbles to establish/reestablish the TLU space-filling topography
	of the network. Anat. Rec. 251:491-527, 1998.  1998 Wiley-Liss,

	which operates directly on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
	representation and, by this, generates smoother and more (spatially
	and temporally) coherent results in an efficient way. The underlying
	predictor-corrector scheme is general enough to be applied to other
	line-type features and it is extendable to the extraction of surfaces
	such as isosurfaces or Lagrangian coherent structures. The proposed
	method exploits temporal coherence to speed up computation for subsequent
	time steps. We show how the predictor-corrector formulation can be
	specialized for several variants of vortex core line definitions
	including two recent unsteady extensions, and we contribute a theoretical
	and practical comparison of these. In particular, we reveal a close
	relation between unsteady extensions of Fuchs et al. and Weinkauf
	et al. and we give a proof of the Galilean invariance of the latter.
	When visualizing SPH data, there is the possibility to use the same
	interpolation method for visualization as has been used for the simulation.
	This is different from the case of finite volume simulation results,
	where it is not possible to recover from the results the spatial
	interpolation that was used during the simulation. Such data are
	typically interpolated using the basic trilinear interpolant, and
	if smoothness is required, some artificial processing is added. In
	SPH data, however, the smoothing kernels are specified from the simulation,
	and they provide an exact and smooth interpolation of data or gradients

	at least one characteristic dimension below 100 nm enables the occurrence
	of phenomena that are impossible at bigger length scales. This research
	field was only recently termed nanofluidics, but it has deep roots
	in science and technology. Nanofluidics has experienced considerable
	growth in recent years, as is confirmed by significant scientific
	and practical achievements. This review focuses on the physical properties
	and operational mechanisms of the most common structures, such as
	nanometer-sized openings and nanowires in solution on a chip. Since
	the surface-to-volume ratio increases with miniaturization, this
	ratio is high in nanochannels, resulting in surface-charge-governed
	transport, which allows ion separation and is described by a comprehensive
	electrokinetic theory. The charge selectivity is most pronounced
	if the Debye screening length is comparable to the smallest dimension
	of the nanochannel cross section, leading to a predominantly counterion
	containing nanometer-sized aperture. These unique properties contribute
	to the charge-based partitioning of biomolecules at the microchannel-nanochannel
	interface. Additionally, at this free-energy barrier, size-based
	partitioning can be achieved when biomolecules and nanoconstrictions
	have similar dimensions. Furthermore, nanopores and nanowires are
	rooted in interesting physical concepts, and since these structures
	demonstrate sensitive, label-free, and real-time electrical detection
	of biomolecules, the technologies hold great promise for the life

  abstract = {The adsorption model for soluble surfactants has been modified for
	suspensions of pulmonary surfactant. The dynamic adsorption behavior
	may be governed by a two-step process: (1) the transfer of molecules
	between the surface layer and the subsurface layer, which has a thickness
	of a few molecular diameters only; (2) the exchange of molecules
	between the subsurface and the bulk solution. The first step is an
	adsorption process and the second step is a mass transfer process.
	Between the subsurface and the bulk solution is an undisturbed boundary
	layer where mass transport occurs by diffusion only. The thickness
	of this boundary layer may be reduced by stirring. Rapid film formation
	by adsorption bursts from lipid extract surfactants, as observed
	in the captive bubble system, suggests that the adsorption process
	as defined above is accompanied by a relatively large negative change
	in the free energy. This reduction in the free energy is provided
	by a configurational change in the association of the specific surfactant
	proteins and the surfactant lipids during adsorption. The negative
	change in the free energy during film formation more than compensates
	for the energy barrier related to the film surface pressure. In the
	traditional view, the extracellular alveolar lining layer is composed
	of two parts, an aqueous subphase and a surfactant film, believed
	to be a monolayer, at the air-water interface. The existence and
	continuity of the aqueous subphase has recently been demonstrated
	by Bastacky and coworkers, and a continuous polymorphous film has
	recently been shown by Bachofen and his associates, using perfusion
	fixation of rabbit lungs with slight edema. In the present chapter,
	we have described a fixation technique using a non-aqueous fixation
	medium of perfluorocarbon and osmium tetroxide to fix the peripheral
	airspaces of guinea pig lungs. A continuous osmiophilic film which
	covers the entire alveolar surface, including the pores of Kohn,
	is demonstrated. By transmission electron microscopy, the surface
	film frequently appears multilaminated, not only in the alveolar
	corners or crevices, but also at the thin air-blood barrier above
	the capillaries. Disk-like structures or multilamellar vesicles appear
	partially integrated into the planar multilayered film. In corners
	and crevices, tubular myelin appears closely associated with the
	surface film. Tubular myelin, however, is not necessary for the generation
	of a multilaminated film. This is demonstrated in vitro by the fixation
	for electron microscopy of a film formed from lipid extract surfactant
	on a captive bubble. Films formed from relatively high surfactant
	concentration (1 mg/ml of phospholipid) are of variable thickness
	and frequent multilayers are seen. In contrast, at 0.3 mg/ml, only
	an amorphous film can be visualized. Although near zero minimum surface
	tensions can be obtained for both surfactant concentrations, film
	compressibility and mechanical stability are substantially better
	at the higher concentrations. This appears to be related to the multilaminated
	structure of the film formed at the higher concentration.},

	for modeling large deformation of fluids including fluids with stress-free
	surfaces. Because of the Lagrangian nature of the method, it is well
	suited to address the thermal evolution of these free surface flows.
	Boundary conditions at the interface of the fluid with a solid wall
	are usually enforced through the use of boundary particles. However,
	applying conditions at free surfaces, in particular gradient boundary
	conditions, can be problematic with traditional SPH formulations
	due to the degradation of the gradient approximation in these regions.
	Compounding this difficulty is that traditional approximations of
	the Laplacian operator suffer a similar degradation near free surfaces.
	A new SPH formulation of the Laplacian operator is presented, which
	improves the accuracy near free surface boundaries. This new form
	is based on a gradient approximation commonly used in thermal, viscous,
	and pressure projection problems, but includes higher-order terms
	in the appropriate Taylor series. Comparisons with other approximations

	similar to N-1.4 and (gamma) over dot(min) similar to N-0.7 as a
	function of chain length N, which implies that the regime of shear-induced
	chain compression widens with increasing chain length. These scaling
	laws also imply that the chain response at high shear rates is not
	a universal function of the Weissenberg number Wi = (gamma) over
	dot tau anymore, where tau is the equilibrium relaxation time. For
	semiflexible polymers a similar non-monotonic stretching response
	is obtained. By extrapolating the simulation results to lengths corresponding
	to experimentally studied DNA molecules, we find that the shear rate
	(gamma) over dot(max) to reach the compression regime is experimentally

	For example, carbon nanotubes, which show rapid and selective transport

	a confining volume are much less than the radius of gyration, a quantitative

	a weak molecular-weight-dependent mobility of polymers confined within
	nanoscopic cylindrical pores having diameters smaller than the dimension
	of the chains in the bulk. On the basis of the chain configuration
	along the pore axis, the measured mobility of polymers in the confined

	The precise flow rate control and well-defined geometries achievable

	observations of the onset of elastically driven flow asymmetries
	in steady flows with strong planar elongational characteristics.
	We consider two different stagnation flow geometries; corresponding
	to T-shaped microchannels with, and without, a recirculating cavity
	region. In the former case, the stagnation point is located on a
	free streamline, whereas in the absence of a recirculating cavity
	the stagnation point at the separating streamline is pinned at the
	confining wall of the microchannel. The kinematic differences in
	these two configurations affect the resulting polymeric stress fields
	and control the critical conditions and spatiotemporal dynamics of
	the resulting viscoelastic flow instability. in the free stagnation
	point flow, a strand of highly oriented polymeric material is formed
	in the region of strong planar extensional flow. This leads to a
	symmetry-breaking bifurcation at moderate Weissenberg numbers followed
	by the onset of three-dimensional flow at high Weissenberg numbers,
	which can be visualized using streak-imaging and microparticle image
	velocimetry. When the stagnation point is pinned at the wall this
	symmetry-breaking transition is suppressed and the flow transitions
	directly to a three-dimensional time-dependent flow at an intermediate
	flow rate. The spatial characteristics of these purely elastic flow
	transitions are compared quantitatively to the predictions of two-dimensional
	viscoelastic numerical simulations using a single-mode simplified
	Phan-Thien-Tanner (SPTT) model. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  abstract = {The flow of a Newtonian fluid and a Boger fluid through sudden square-square
	contractions was investigated experimentally aiming to characterize
	the flow and provide quantitative data for benchmarking in a complex
	three-dimensional flow. Visualizations of the flow patterns were
	undertaken using streak-line photography, detailed velocity field
	measurements were conducted using particle image velocimetry (PIV)
	and pressure drop measurements were performed in various geometries
	with different contraction ratios. For the Newtonian fluid, the experimental
	results are compared with numerical simulations performed using a
	finite volume method, and excellent agreement is found for the range
	of Reynolds number tested (Re-2 <= 23). For the viscoelastic case,
	recirculations are still present upstream of the contraction but
	we also observe other complex flow patterns that are dependent on
	contraction ratio (CR) and Deborah number (De(2)) for the range of
	conditions studied: CR = 2.4, 4, 8, 12 and De(2) <= 150. For low
	contraction ratios strong divergent flow is observed upstream of
	the contraction, whereas for high contraction ratios there is no
	upstream divergent flow, except in the vicinity of the re-entrant
	corner where a localized atypical divergent flow is observed. For
	all contraction ratios studied, at sufficiently high Deborah numbers,
	strong elastic vortex enhancement upstream of the contraction is
	observed, which leads to the onset of a periodic complex flow at
	higher flow rates. The vortices observed under steady flow are not
	closed, and fluid elasticity was found to modify the flow direction
	within the recirculations as compared to that found for Newtonian
	fluids. The entry pressure drop, quantified using a Couette correction,
	was found to increase with the Deborah number for the higher contraction
	ratios. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	DNA through a siliconoxicle nanopore. Long DNA molecules with different
	lengths ranging from 6500 to 97000 base pairs have been electrophoretically
	driven through a 10 nm pore. We observe a power-law scaling of the
	translocation time with the length, with an exponent of 1.27. This
	nonlinear scaling is strikingly different from the well-studied linear
	behavior observed in similar experiments performed on protein pores.
	We present a theoretical model where hydrodynamic drag on the section
	of the polymer outside the pore is the dominant force counteracting
	the electrical driving force. We show that this applies to our experiments,
	and we derive a power-law scaling with an exponent of 1.22, in good
	agreement with the data.},

	scaling properties of the ensemble difference for two different chain
	models as a function of the degree of polymerization. By characterizing
	the scaling behavior of the difference between the isotensional (Gibbs)
	and isometric (Helmholtz) ensembles in the transition from the low-stretching
	to the high-stretching regime, we show that ensemble equivalence
	cannot be reached for macroscopic chains in the low force regime,

	viscosities different from bulk values derived from uniform, steady

  abstract = {A Lagrangian particle model for multiphase multicomponent fluid flow,
	based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), was developed and
	used to simulate the flow of an emulsion consisting of bubbles of
	a non-wetting liquid surrounded by a wetting liquid. In SPH simulations,
	fluids are represented by sets of particles that are used as discretization
	points to solve the Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics equations. In the
	multiphase multicomponent SPH model, a modified van der Waals equation
	of state is used to close the system of flow equations. The combination
	of the momentum conservation equation with the van der Waals equation
	of state results in a particle equation of motion in which the total
	force acting on each particle consists of many-body repulsive and
	viscous forces, two-body (particle-particle) attractive forces, and
	body forces such as gravitational forces. Similar to molecular dynamics,
	for a given fluid component the combination of repulsive and attractive
	forces causes phase separation. The surface tension at liquid-liquid
	interfaces is imposed through component dependent attractive forces.
	The wetting behavior of the fluids is controlled by phase dependent
	attractive interactions between the fluid particles and stationary
	particles that represent the solid phase. The dynamics of fluids
	away from the interface is governed by purely hydrodynamic forces.
	Comparison with analytical solutions for static conditions and relatively
	simple flows demonstrates the accuracy of the SPH model. (C) 2009

  abstract = {The conformational properties of a model macromolecule, namely DNA,
	in an oscillatory shear flow have been investigated using Brownian
	dynamics (BD) simulations. To elucidate the influence of time periodic
	motion on the chain dynamics, the simulation results have been compared
	to previous experimental and BD simulation studies in steady simple
	shear flow. Based on these comparisons, we have determined that when
	the Deborah number (De), defined as the product of polymer relaxation
	time (lambda) and the angular forcing frequency, is less than a critical
	De(T), which corresponds to f(T)/2, where f(T) is the tumbling frequency
	of the chain in a corresponding simple steady shear flow, macromolecules
	exhibit similar dynamics as their steady shear flow counterpart in
	each half-cycle. Specifically, at De < De(T) the polymer chain experiences
	end-over-end tumbling events in each half-cycle, which give rise
	to odd harmonics in the power spectral density (PSD) of the orientation
	angle, where the fundamental mode of frequency corresponds to the
	forcing frequency f(c). At De>De(T), chain flipping is the predominant
	event observed. Thus there are two distinct regions in the De/De(T)
	parameter space: (1) a plateau regime at De/De(T)<= 1, where the
	chain dynamics and average conformational properties of the macromolecules
	are essentially the same as the corresponding steady shear flow,

  abstract = {Modelling fluid flows past a surface is a general problem in science
	and engineering, and requires some assumption about the nature of
	the fluid motion (the boundary condition) at the solid interface,
	One of the simplest boundary conditions is the no-slip condition(1,2),
	which dictates that a liquid element adjacent to the surface assumes
	the velocity of the surface, Although this condition has been remarkably
	successful in reproducing the characteristics of many types of flow
	there exist situations in which it leads to singular or unrealistic
	behaviour-for example, the spreading of a liquid on a solid substrate(3-8),
	corner flow(9,10) and the extrusion of polymer melts from a capillary
	tube(11-13). Numerous boundary conditions that allow for finite slip
	at the solid interface have been used to rectify these difficulties(4,5,11,13,14).
	But these phenomenological models fail to provide a universal picture
	of the momentum transport that occurs at liquid/solid interfaces,
	Here we present results from molecular dynamics simulations of newtonian
	liquids under shear which indicate that there exists a general nonlinear
	relationship between the amount of slip and the local shear rate
	at a solid surface, The boundary condition is controlled by the extent
	to which the liquid 'feels' corrugations in the surface energy of
	the solid (owing in the present case to the atomic close-packing),
	Our generalized boundary condition allows us to relate the degree
	of slip to the underlying static properties and dynamic interactions
	of the walls and the fluid.},

	of single polymer chains across a nanosized pore under the driving
	of an applied field (chemical potential gradient). The translocation
	process can be either dominated by the entropic barrier resulted
	from restricted motion of flexible polymer chains or by applied forces
	(or chemical gradient across the wall), we focused on the latter
	case in our studies. Calculation of radius of gyrations at the two
	opposite sides of the wall shows that the polymer chains are not
	in equilibrium during the translocation process. Despite this fact,
	our results show that the one-dimensional diffusion and the nucleation
	model provide an excellent description of the dependence of average
	translocation time on the chemical potential gradients, the polymer
	chain length and the solvent viscosity. In good agreement with experimental
	results and theoretical predictions, the translocation time distribution
	of our simple model shows strong non-Gaussian characteristics. It
	is observed that even for this simple tubelike pore geometry, more
	than one peak of translocation time distribution can be generated
	for proper pore diameter and applied field strengths. Both repulsive
	Weeks-Chandler-Anderson and attractive Lennard-Jones polymer-nanopore
	interaction were studied, attraction facilitates the translocation
	process by shortening the total translocation time and dramatically
	improve the capturing of polymer chain. The width of the translocation
	time distribution was found to decrease with increasing temperature,
	increasing field strength, and decreasing pore diameter. (C) 2003

	Interfacial terms are accounted for by adding the appropriate sources
	as [delta] functions at the boundary separating the phases. The unsteady

	is done by following the motion of the front. The method has been
	implemented for fully three-dimensional flows, as well as for two-dimensional
	and axisymmetric ones. First, the method is described for the flow
	of two or more isothermal phases. The representation of the moving
	interface and its dynamic restructuring, as well as the transfer
	of information between the moving front and the fixed grid, are discussed.

	to allow discrimination between same size DNA carrying a bent at

	of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations of a coarse-grained
	polymer melt. A set of monodisperse systems with increasing chain
	length is examined. We consider both static and dynamic aspects of
	the problem. Part 1, this paper,deals with the continuous change
	or the polymer topology, from unentangled (short chains), to entangled
	(long chains). We show that as chain length increases the rate of
	increase of chain overlap increases asymptotically. It becomes constant
	when chains are sufficiently long, and in this regime a long chain
	topology is established. Next, we examine the onset by probing static
	length scales at the level of primitive paths (PPs). A simple scaling
	model based on a transformation of PPs from thin rods (short chains)
	to random walks (RWs) (long chains) is discussed qualitatively and
	quantitatively. The model predicts a crossover in the underlying
	topology, which leads to a Rouse to reptation transition in dynamics
	when PP conformations change from rods to to RWs. The entanglement
	molecular weight is interpreted as the crossover length of this transition.
	The predicted M-c/M-c ratio is one, which, though small, is compatible
	with packing length independence and the suppression of contour length
	fluctuations within the model. Part 11, the following paper (DOI
	10.1021/ma9011329), deals with dynamic aspects of the onset of entanglements,
	making possible a comparison between static and dynamic length scales.},

  abstract = {We describe the algorithms implemented in the first version of GRADSPH,
	a parallel, tree-based, smoothed particle hydrodynamics code for
	simulating self-gravitating astrophysical systems written in FORTRAN
	90. The paper presents details on the implementation of the Smoothed
	Particle Hydro (SPH) description, where a gridless approach is used
	to model compressible gas dynamics. This is done in the conventional
	SPH way by means of 'particles' which sample fluid properties, exploiting
	interpolating kernels. The equations of self-gravitating hydrodynamics
	in the SPH framework are derived self-consistently from a Lagrangian
	and account for variable smoothing lengths ('GRAD-h') terms in both
	the hydrodynamic and gravitational acceleration equations. A Barnes-Hut
	tree is used for treating self-gravity and updating the neighbour
	list of the particles. In addition, the code updates particle properties
	on their own individual timesteps and uses a basic parallelisation
	strategy to speed up calculations on a parallel Computer system with
	distributed memory architecture. Extensive tests of the code in one
	and three dimensions are presented. Finally. we describe the program
	organisation of the publicly available 31) version of the code, as
	well as details concerning the structure of the input and output
	files and the execution of the program. Program summary Program title:

	On the basis of numerical results, four different regimes can be

	For intermediate values the coil orientates without being squeezed
	considerably. For still smaller values the coil is squeezed with
	a corresponding decrease in the value of the radius of gyration.
	A further reduction in slit width is accompanied by a sharp increase
	in the value of the radius of gyration, signaling the onset of the
	transition from three- to two-dimensional behavior. L-Dependent scaling
	relations are supposed to be valid in the latter regime. Using Monte

  abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is becoming increasingly common
	in the numerical simulation of complex fluid flows and an understanding
	of the errors is necessary. Recent advances have established techniques
	for ensuring completeness conditions (low-order polynomials are interpolated
	exactly) are enforced when estimating property gradients, but the
	consequences on errors have not been investigated. Here, we present
	an expression for the error in an SPH estimate, accounting for completeness,
	an expression that applies to SPH generally. We revisit the derivation
	of the SPH equations for fluids, paying particular attention to the
	conservation principles. We find that a common method for enforcing
	completeness violates a property required of the kernel gradients,
	namely that gradients with respect the two position variables be
	equal and opposite. In such models this means conservation principles
	are not enforced and we present results that show this. As an aside
	we show the summation interpolant for density is a solution of, and
	may be used in the place of, the discretized, symmetrized continuity
	equation. Finally, we examine two examples of discretization errors,

	style in solvent-filled nanochannels. The new methods were demonstrated
	by carrying out NEMD simulations of free single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
	molecules of 21 bases as well as double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA) molecules
	of 21 base pairs tethered on gold surfaces in an ionic water shear
	flow. The tethering of the linker molecule (6-mercapto-1-hexanol)
	to perfect Au(111) surfaces was parametrized based on density functional
	theory (DFT) calculations. Force field parameters were incorporated
	into the CHARMM database. Gold surfaces are simulated in a Lennard-Jones
	style model that was fitted to the Morse potential model of bulk
	gold. The bonding force of attachment of the DNA molecules to the
	gold substrate linker molecule was computed to be up to a few nN
	when the DNA molecules are fully stretched at high shear rates. For
	the first time, we calculated the relaxation time of DNA molecules
	in picoseconds (ps) and the hydrodynamic force up to a few nanoNewtons
	(nN) per base pair in a nanochannel flow. The velocity profiles in
	the solvent due to the presence of the tethered DNA molecules were
	found to be nonlinear only at high shear flow rates. Free ssDNA molecules
	in a shear flow were observed to behave differently from each other
	depending upon their initial orientation in the flow field. Both
	free and tethered DNA molecules are clearly observed to be stretching,
	rotating and relaxing. Methods developed in this initial work can
	be incorporated into multiscale simulations including quantum mechanical,
	molecular and the microfluidic continuum regimes. The results may
	also be useful in extending existing macroscopic empirical models
	of DNA response dynamics in shear flows.},

	In this work, a coarse-grained hybrid molecular dynamics (CGH-MD)

	Simulation results are consistent with observations and reported

	predictions. We subsequently applied our model to study the effect
	of shear flow on end-tethered polymer layers ("brushes"). When exposed
	to a constant shear flow, chains in a polymer brush are stretched
	in the direction of the flow, and the overall layer thickness decreases.
	This result is similar to what was found in previous simulation studies.
	However, in the present simulations solvent particles are taken into
	account explicitly. At low frequencies, the response of a brush to
	oscillatory shear is qualitatively similar to its response to constant
	shear. As the flow velocity changes during an oscillation cycle,
	the polymer chains are able to relax their configurations with respect
	to the shear rate. At higher frequencies the interpretation of the

  abstract = {Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) has, with only a few exceptions,
	been used to study hydrodynamic behavior of complex fluids without
	confinement. Previous studies used a periodic boundary condition,
	and only bulk behavior can be studied effectively. However, if solid
	walls play an important role in the problem to be studied, a no-slip
	boundary condition in DPD is required. Until now the methods used
	to impose a solid wall consisted of a frozen layer of particles.
	If the wall density is equal to the density of the simulated domain,
	slip phenomena are observed. To suppress this slip, the density of
	the wall has to be increased. We introduce a new method, which intrinsically
	imposes the noslip boundary condition without the need to artificially
	increase the density in the wall. The method is tested in both a
	steady-state and an instationary calculation. If repulsion is applied
	in frozen particle methods, density distortions are observed. We
	propose a method to avoid these distortions. Finally, this method
	is tested against conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
	calculations for the flow in a lid-driven cavity. Excellent agreement

	are examined: linear translocation where a chain enters the confined

	but decreases with polymer length for hairpin entries. Applying to
	electrophoresis of DNA molecules through periodic spacious and confined

  abstract = {Microelectronic circuits often fail because cracks and voids cause
	open circuits in their interconnects. Many of the mechanisms of failure
	are believed to be associated with diffusion of material along the
	surfaces, interfaces or grain boundaries in the line; material may
	also flow through the lattice of the crystal. The diffusion is driven
	by variations in elastic strain energy and stress in the solid, and
	by the flow of electric current. To predict the conditions necessary
	for failure to occur in an interconnect, one must account for the
	influence of both deformation and electric current flow through the
	interior of the solid, and also for the effects of mass flow. To
	this end, we describe a two dimensional finite element method for
	computing the motion and evolution of voids by surface diffusion
	in an elastic, electrically conducting solid. Various case studies
	are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and capabilities of the
	method, including the evolution of a void towards a circular shape
	due to diffusion driven by surface energy, the migration and evolution
	of a void in a conducting strip due to electromigration induced surface
	diffusion, and the evolution of a void in an elastic solid due to

	property treat curved boundaries in complicated flow domains. These
	drawbacks have been remedied in a new boundary treatment method presented
	in this article, called the multiple boundary tangent (MBT) approach.
	In this article we present two important benchmark problems to validate
	the developed algorithm and show that the multiple boundary tangent
	treatment produces results that agree with known numerical and experimental
	solutions. The two benchmark problems chosen are the lid-driven cavity
	problem, and flow over a cylinder. The SPH solutions using the MBT
	approach and the results from literature are in very good agreement.
	These solutions involved solid boundaries, but the approach presented
	herein should be extendable to time-evolving, free-surface boundaries.

	gradients of morphogens(1,2). How exactly these gradients are formed,

	gradients in living zebrafish embryos are established andmaintained
	by two essential factors: fast, free diffusion of single molecules
	away from the source through extracellular space, and a sink function
	of the receiving cells, regulated by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
	Evidence is provided by directly examining single molecules of Fgf8
	in living tissue by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, quantifying
	their local mobility and concentration with high precision. By changing
	the degree of uptake of Fgf8 into its target cells, we are able to
	alter the shape of the Fgf8 gradient. Our results demonstrate that
	a freely diffusing morphogen can set up concentration gradients in
	a complex multicellular tissue by a simple source-sink mechanism.},

	of single DNA molecules confined in a nanochannel was investigated

	volume fraction of the crowding agent. Under crowded conditions,
	the channel diameter is effectively reduced, which is interpreted
	in terms of depletion in DNA segment density in the interfacial region
	next to the channel wall. Confinement in a nanochannel also facilitates
	compaction with a neutral crowding agent at low ionic strength. The
	threshold volume fraction for condensation is proportional to the
	size of the nanoparticle, due to depletion induced attraction between
	DNA segments. We found that the effect of crowding is not only related
	to the colligative properties of the agent and that confinement is
	also important. It is the interplay between anisotropic confinement
	and osmotic pressure which gives the elongated conformation and the
	possibility for condensation at low ionic strength.},
